UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::11:::18:::Uranus and Neptune exhibit fast surface zonal winds that can reach up to a few hundred meters per second.
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::234:::241:::Through a case-by-case comparison between the missing dynamical gravitational harmonic ${J}_{4}^{{\prime} }$ from structure models, and with that expected from fluid perturbations, we put constraints on zonal wind decay in Uranus and Neptune.
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::77:::84:::To this end, we generate polytropic empirical structure models of Uranus and Neptune using fourth-order theory of figures that leave hydrostatic J <SUB>4</SUB> as an open parameter.
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::123:::130:::The decay scale heights are virtually insensitive to the proposed modifications to the bulk rotation periods of Uranus and Neptune in the literature.
UAT:::1300:::Protoplanetary disks:::102:::122:::This finding has two key implications: (1) planets in single-star systems tend to form within aligned protoplanetary disks, and (2) warm Jupiters form more quiescently than hot Jupiters, which, in single-star systems, are likely perturbed into a misaligned state through planet-planet interactions in the post-disk-dispersal phase.
UAT:::2173:::Planetary dynamics:::29:::47:::Due to the chaotic nature of planetary dynamics, there is a non-zero probability that Mercury's orbit will become unstable in the future.
UAT:::2173:::Planetary dynamics:::67:::85:::QDMC is easy to implement and could be applied to many problems in planetary dynamics in which it is necessary to estimate the probability of a rare event.
UAT:::1158:::Oort cloud objects:::65:::83:::Our simulations further show that although inward-injected inner Oort cloud objects exhibit P9-driven orbital confinement, the degree of clustering is weaker than that of objects originating within the Kuiper Belt.
UAT:::1545:::Probe:::28:::33:::As part of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISâŠ™IS) suite, EPI-Lo was designed to investigate the physics of energetic particles; however, in the special lowest-energy "time-of-flight only" product used in this study, it also responds to solar photons in a subset of approximately sunward-looking apertures lacking special light-attenuating foils.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::153:::157:::To address this issue, this paper presents an approach that reuses the image dehazing knowledge obtained on Earth to resolve the dust-removal problem on Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::191:::195:::Qualitative and quantitative results show that dust storms can be effectively eliminated by the proposed approach, leading to obviously improved topographical and geomorphological details of Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::38:::42:::This scenario may mirror locations on Mars interrogated by mobile vehicles (e.g., Perseverance rover in Jezero crater).
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::77:::81:::A Rover team commanded a human rover to execute observations based on common Mars rover sequences; the resulting data were used to characterize the geologic history of the location.
UAT:::1475:::Solar activity:::90:::104:::We analyze the spectral characteristics of GWs in the thermosphere on Mars during the low solar activity of Martian Year (MY) 35, based on CO<SUB>2</SUB> density measured by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on board Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN).
UAT:::1475:::Solar activity:::58:::72:::The results are compared with those of MY33 at the higher solar activity.
UAT:::1475:::Solar activity:::173:::187:::Compared to MY33, GW activity is larger and less attenuated in MY35 as it propagates upward, implying that waves experience more favorable propagation conditions during low solar activity.
UAT:::1475:::Solar activity:::283:::297:::Also, the dependence of GW activity on local time during this period is found to be different from previous studies, with the strongest GWs in the spring of MY35 occurring within 6-12 hr on the dayside, suggesting that the amplitude of the GWs in the Martian thermosphere during low solar activity is less controlled by the background temperature and is subject to dissipative effects of other factors, such as molecular viscosity and thermal conduction.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::100:::104:::Observations show two different transient atmospheric events around the northern winter solstice on Mars: a warming of the polar lower atmosphere (100-10 Pa) and a reduction in the near-surface wave activity.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::149:::153:::Here we examine the cause of, and connections between, these two events, and how their occurrence may have changed in past climates using a suite of Mars general circulation model simulations.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::48:::52:::Small convective vortices occur ubiquitously on Mars, frequently as dust devils, and they produce detectable signals in meteorological data-in pressure, temperature, and wind speed and direction.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::48:::52:::Fortunately, the growing cache of data from the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer instrument suite on board the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover promises to elucidate these relationships.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::110:::114:::We present an analysis of 450 solitary wave pulses observed by the Langmuir Probe and Waves instrument on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft during its five passes around Mars on 2015 February 9.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::28:::32:::An essential part of the Exomars 2022 payload is the Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies (Ma_MISS) experiment hosted by the drill system.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::168:::172:::Ma_MISS is the instrument that will closely investigate the subsurface mineralogical characteristics in its original geologic context at depths never reached before in Mars exploration.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::111:::115:::Ma_MISS recognizes all the major spectral features of the clays, basaltic, and minor phases expected at the ExoMars landing site, Oxia Planum.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::61:::65:::For example, the rms error of solar wind speed prediction at Mars is only 66 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and at Pluto is a mere 25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::68:::72:::The formation and stability of brines on the surface of present-day Mars remains an important question to resolve the astrobiological potential of the red planet.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::228:::232:::We find that such brines would form in equilibrium with sodium and magnesium perchlorates, chlorides, and calcium chlorate, but never calcium perchlorate, which has been widely considered as the most likely to produce brines on Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::248:::252:::It is a long-standing open question whether electrification of wind-blown sand due to tribocharging-the generation of electric charges on the surface of sand grains by particle-particle collisions-could affect rates of sand transport occurrence on Mars substantially.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::174:::178:::Our results imply that particle transport that subsides, once the wind shear velocity has fallen below the threshold for sustained transport, can more easily be restarted on Mars than previously thought.
UAT:::1262:::Plasma clouds:::4:::17:::The plasma clouds (explosive bulk plasma escape), considered an important ion escaping channel, have been recently identified by spacecraft observations.
UAT:::1262:::Plasma clouds:::37:::50:::However, our knowledge about Martian plasma clouds is lacking.
UAT:::1262:::Plasma clouds:::124:::137:::Based on the observations of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft, we study a sequence of periodic plasma clouds that occurred at low altitudes (~600 km) on Mars.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::96:::106:::With the aid of the ion densities measured by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer and the solar wind dynamic pressures measured by the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN, we investigate the modulation of a sequence of ion species in the Martian topside ionosphere by the upstream solar wind condition.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::124:::134:::Almost all ion species, except for ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}^{+}$ and OCOH<SUP>+</SUP>, are very sensitive to the variation of the solar wind condition, and their densities decrease with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::69:::79:::The response of the topside ion distribution to the variation of the solar wind condition is also found to be remarkably related to the magnetic field orientation, in that the solar wind modulation occurs mainly over regions with near-horizontal field lines.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::98:::108:::These observations imply substantially enhanced outflow velocities for all ion species under high solar wind dynamic pressures when the ambient magnetic fields are near-horizontal.
UAT:::1255:::Planetary science:::240:::257:::This work is thus an overview of the current status of Mars Polar Science and is intended to serve as a road map for the direction of the field during the next 4 yr and beyond, helping to shape its contribution within the larger context of planetary science and exploration.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::141:::145:::Using spacecraft data and elemental abundances derived from martian meteorites, earlier studies set a paradigm of a volatile- and water-rich Mars relative to Earth.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::86:::90:::Nevertheless, inherent difficulty in determining the volatile budget of bulk silicate Mars (BSM) makes it challenging to directly compare the extents of volatile depletions among differentiated bodies in the Solar System.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::77:::81:::This study provides an alternative for evaluating the nature of volatiles on Mars using potassium (K) isotopes.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::64:::68:::Volcanic features and impact craters are ubiquitous features on Mars, and hydrothermal systems associated with the production of these features should have been abundant in Mars's early history.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::18:::22:::Here we present a Mars analog study where basaltic magma intruded water-bearing sediments to produce a high-temperature (as high as ~700Â°C) hydrothermal system, which we use to constrain the potential habitability of similar systems on Mars via mineralogy and geochemistry including S, C, and O isotopic systematics.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::79:::83:::One of the most interesting questions about the climate and hydrology of early Mars is whether oceans existed and, if so, when.
UAT:::829:::Interplanetary shocks:::49:::70:::The results can help us understand the nature of interplanetary shocks propagating in different environments.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::0:::4:::Mars is cold today but once had lakes.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::73:::77:::We evaluated the water ice cloud greenhouse hypothesis for warming early Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::82:::86:::As this scenario is consistent with geologic data that suggest a warm, arid early Mars climate, our results support the cloud greenhouse hypothesis for warming early Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::97:::101:::In the present study, we utilize extensive measurements made by several instruments on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft, in order to perform data-driven computations of the nightside neutral, ion, and electron heating rates.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::89:::93:::Considering the large range of energetic electron intensity observed on the nightside of Mars, we divide the entire data set into two subsamples, either with or without energetic electron depletion, a notable feature of the nightside Martian ionosphere.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::51:::55:::Aeolian sediment transport is observed to occur on Mars as well as other extraterrestrial environments, generating ripples and dunes as on Earth.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::87:::91:::Glacial landforms, including lobate debris aprons, are a global water ice reservoir on Mars preserving ice from past periods when high orbital obliquity permitted nonpolar ice accumulation.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::13:::17:::On Earth and Mars, these landforms consist of a core of flowing ice covered by a rocky lag.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::12:::16:::However, on Mars, it is not known whether glacial landforms emplaced over the past 300 to 800 formed during a single, long deposition event or during multiple glaciations.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::113:::117:::Correlation between latitude and boulder clustering suggests that ice mass-balance works across global scales on Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::95:::99:::Lobate debris aprons may preserve ice spanning multiple glacial/interglacial cycles, extending Mars climate records back hundreds of millions of years.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::111:::115:::We discovered a zircon record in a Martian meteorite that spans 4.2 Gyr, nearly the entire geologic history of Mars.
UAT:::1722:::Twilight:::51:::59:::An observer on the surface of Mars would thus find twilight becoming deeper much more rapidly than on the Earth.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::15:::25:::Effects of the solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>d</SUB>), the magnetosonic Mach number (M<SUB>MS</SUB>), and the intensity and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on the seven parameters are examined based on 250 simulation cases.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::64:::74:::These 250 cases have a P<SUB>d</SUB> range of 0.36-9.0 nPa (the solar wind number density varying from 3.5 to 12 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and the solar wind speed varying from 250 to 670 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), an M<SUB>MS</SUB> range of 2.8-7.9, and an IMF strength range from zero to 10 nT.
UAT:::1534:::Solar wind:::325:::335:::(3) The effects of IMF components on the bow shock position are associated with the draping and pileup of the IMF around the Martian ionosphere; hence, we find that both the subsolar standoff distance and the flaring angle of the bow shock increase with the field strength of the IMF components that are perpendicular to the solar wind flow direction (B<SUB>Y</SUB> and B<SUB>Z</SUB> in the MSO coordinate system).
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::106:::110:::In this study we show recurrent energetic electron and proton enhancements observed near Earth (1 au) and Mars (1.43-1.38 au) during this period.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::184:::188:::The observations near Earth use data from instruments on board the Advanced Composition Explorer, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, and Solar Dynamics Observatory and those near Mars are from the Solar Energetic Particle, Solar Wind Ion Analyzer, and Magnetometer instruments on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN).
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::74:::78:::During this period, the energetic electron fluxes observed near Earth and Mars showed prominent periodic enhancements over four solar rotations, with major periodicities of âˆ¼27 days and âˆ¼13 days.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::56:::60:::Periodic radar blackouts/weakenings of radar signals at Mars were observed by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding/Mars Express, and are associated with these solar energetic electron enhancements.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::57:::61:::The close approach of comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) to Mars in 2014 October provided a unique opportunity to observe a dynamically new Oort cloud comet with potential for interaction with a planet's atmosphere.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::138:::142:::The present study analyzes a unique data set of high spectral resolution UV observations of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring measured by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::0:::4:::Mars shares many similarities and characteristics to Earth including various geological features and planetary structure.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::190:::194:::The remarkable bimodal distribution of elevations in both planets is one of the most striking global features suggesting similar geodynamic processes of crustal differentiation on Earth and Mars.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::45:::49:::Moreover, if oceans were formerly present on Mars, there is still significant ambiguity about the volume of water with the estimations ranging over 4 orders of magnitude.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::132:::136:::Here we map the Martian sea level problem onto a percolation model that provides strong evidence that the longest isoheight line on Mars that separates the northern and southern hemispheres acts as a critical level height with divergent correlation length and plays the same role as the present mean sea level does on Earth.
UAT:::1007:::Mars:::52:::56:::Our results unravel remarkable similarities between Mars and Earth, posing a testable hypothesis about the level of the ancient ocean on Mars that can be answered experimentally by the future investigations and spacecraft exploration.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::38:::50:::The abundance of iron-60 in the early solar system is important for planetary evolution models, and has been hotly debated.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::87:::99:::To put further constraints on the initial <SUP>60</SUP>Fe/<SUP>56</SUP>Fe ratio of the solar system, here we present new iron-nickel isotope data, measured in situ by NanoSIMS, for 14 silicate chondrules from three carbonaceous and three unequilibrated ordinary chondrites.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::119:::131:::Our isotope data hint at a possible difference between the initial <SUP>60</SUP>Fe/<SUP>56</SUP>Fe ratios of the early solar system's two major isotope reservoirs, with the carbonaceous chondritic reservoir having higher iron-60 abundance than the non-carbonaceous reservoir.
UAT:::72:::Asteroid:::0:::8:::Asteroid 2022 NX<SUB>1</SUB> experienced a temporarily-captured flyby in 1981, has had another one in 2022, and will become a temporarily-captured orbiter in 2051.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::64:::76:::It is argued that the closest past flyby of a known star to the solar system was that of Scholz's star (WISE J072003.20-084651.2).
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::97:::109:::Short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) provide important information about the chronology of the early solar system.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::210:::222:::Among them, <SUP>41</SUP>Ca, due to its decay to <SUP>41</SUP>K with a half-life of only 0.1 Ma, is particularly valuable in constraining the timescales and origins of both SLRs and the formation of the oldest solar system materials, the Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs).
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::48:::60:::The initial abundance of <SUP>41</SUP>Ca in the solar system, expressed as the (<SUP>41</SUP>Ca/<SUP>40</SUP>Ca)<SUB>I</SUB> ratio, is the key to unveiling the origin of this nuclide.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::22:::34:::Here, we report a new solar system (<SUP>41</SUP>Ca/<SUP>40</SUP>Ca)<SUB>I</SUB> ratio of 2.0 Ã— 10<SUP>-8</SUP> derived from the K isotope compositions of two CAIs.
UAT:::1715:::Trojans:::61:::68:::This paper explores the long-term stability of six Neptunian Trojans.
UAT:::1715:::Trojans:::33:::40:::In contrast with other Neptunian Trojans, these objects have previously unknown lifetimes and larger orbital uncertainties due to their shorter observational arcs.
UAT:::1715:::Trojans:::38:::45:::We obtained new astrometry of the six Trojans using the Magellan telescope, refit their orbits, and performed Gyr-long numerical integrations to estimate their lifetimes.
UAT:::280:::Comets:::68:::74:::Compositionally, compared to their respective mean abundances among comets from the Oort cloud, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB> and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH were enriched, CH<SUB>4</SUB> and HCN were near normal, and all other species were depleted.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::57:::69:::Despite extensive searches and the relative proximity of solar system objects (SSOs) to Earth, many remain undiscovered and there is still much to learn about their properties and interactions.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::58:::65:::In the standard scenario of planet formation, terrestrial planets, ice giants, and cores of gas giants are formed by the accumulation of planetesimals.

UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::153:::165:::Future, large-scale, exoplanet direct-imaging missions will be capable of discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets and star systems like our solar system.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::22:::34:::Here, we consider the solar system as a previously unexplored exosystem, viewed by an external direct-imaging observer for the first time.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::119:::131:::We find that an external observer could see as many as six (s, Î”mag)-coincidence locations between the Earth and other solar system planets.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::51:::63:::We determine locations of (s, Î”mag)-coincidence of solar system planets using realistic planet phase functions and planet properties.
UAT:::1184:::Orbits:::134:::140:::If this is true, the material generated will also be short-lived, but fireball observation networks still detect material on cometary orbits.
UAT:::1184:::Orbits:::150:::156:::This study examines centimeter-to-meter-scale sporadic meteoroids detected by the Desert Fireball Network from 2014 to 2020 originating from JFC-like orbits.
UAT:::1184:::Orbits:::65:::71:::Our results indicate that <4% of sporadic meteoroids on JFC-like orbits are genetically cometary.
UAT:::1184:::Orbits:::67:::73:::Even when considering shower contributions, meteoroids on JFC-like orbits are primarily from the main belt.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::99:::111:::Here we present new optical color measurements of cold classical KBOs from the Colors of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, including colors of a blue binary discovered by the Solar System Origins Legacy Surveyâ€”2015 RJ277.
UAT:::893:::Kuiper belt:::94:::105:::On 2019 January 1, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by (486958) Arrokoth, a small body in the Kuiper Belt that is the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft.
UAT:::893:::Kuiper belt:::96:::107:::This suggests the past presence of H<SUB>2</SUB>S ice on the surface of Arrokoth and a role for Kuiper Belt objects as a key S reservoir in the early solar system.
UAT:::1267:::Pluto:::13:::18:::The orbit of Pluto has been improved from use of stellar occultation data reduced against the Gaia star catalog.
UAT:::1715:::Trojan asteroids:::4:::20:::The Trojan asteroids of Mars and Jupiter are long-term stable, those of Earth are expected to be just transient companions.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::74:::86:::Future stellar encounters with the Sun might disturb the outskirts of the solar system, for close-enough passages.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::70:::82:::Such encounters may send small bodies toward the inner regions of the solar system.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::198:::210:::Our new estimate confirms, within errors, those already published, but suggests a slightly closer in distance (at 0.051 Â± 0.003 pc) and later in time (in 1.29 Â± 0.04 Myr) flyby of Gliese 710 to the solar system.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::89:::101:::We share the source code and a 121 GB data set of 96 long-term N-body simulations of the solar system.

UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::77:::89:::Through this sequence of events, the characteristic timescale over which the solar system will be completely dissolved is roughly 100 Gyr.
UAT:::1528:::Solar system:::72:::84:::Our analysis thus indicates that the expected dynamical lifetime of the solar system is much longer than the current age of the universe, but is significantly shorter than previous estimates.
UAT:::1184:::Orbits:::75:::81:::Axisymmetric disks of high-eccentricity, low-mass bodies on near-Keplerian orbits are unstable to an out-of-plane buckling.
UAT:::1184:::Orbits:::128:::134:::We also show that the instability should produce a "perihelion gap" at semimajor axes of hundreds of astronomical units, as the orbits of the remnant population are more likely to have extremely large perihelion distances ( ${ \mathcal O }(100\,\mathrm{au})$ ) than intermediate values.

UAT:::228:::Chondrites:::10:::20:::Enstatite chondrites (ECs) have isotope compositions for multiple elements that match that of the Earth and, thus, are considered to be good analogs of the precursor material from which the Earth formed.
UAT:::228:::Chondrites:::124:::134:::Here, we report the first high-precision mass-independent Cr isotope data of nine chondrules in one of the least-altered EH chondrites, Sahara 97096.

UAT:::2120:::Atmospheric composition:::154:::177:::We suggest that if Jupiter's outermost layer is fully mixed and is relatively thin (up to ~20% of its mass), such late accretion can explain its measured atmospheric composition.
UAT:::1248:::Planetary interior:::121:::139:::We find that ice and rock are expected to remain mixed, due to miscibility at high pressure, in substantial parts of the planetary interior for billions of years.
UAT:::1248:::Planetary interior:::41:::59:::We conclude that when ice is abundant in planetary interiors the planet structure may differ significantly from the standard layered structure of a water shell on top of a rocky core.

UAT:::498:::Planets:::59:::66:::In this work, we simulate the thermal evolution of gaseous planets and explore how various common model assumptions such as different equations of state, opacities, and heavy-element distributions affect the inferred radius and metallicity.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::176:::183:::While we confirm the mass-metallicity trend previously reported in the literature, this correlation disappears when removing a 20 M<SUB>âŠ•</SUB> heavy-element core from all the planets.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::91:::98:::We also show that using an updated hydrogen-helium equation of state leads to more compact planets.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::28:::35:::As a result, we present six planets that should be classified as inflated warm Jupiters.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::101:::108:::We next demonstrate that including the opacity enhancement due to metal-rich envelopes of irradiated planets changes the planetary radius significantly, which can have large effects on the inferred metallicity.

UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::89:::96:::The problem is best addressed by forward modeling where different initial conditions and Neptune's orbital evolutions are tested, and the model predictions are compared to orbits of known Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs).
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::40:::47:::It has previously been established that Neptune radially migrated, by gravitationally interacting with an outer disk of planetesimals, from the original radial distance r â‰² 25 au to its current orbit at 30 au.
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::79:::86:::Here we show that the migration models with a very low orbital eccentricity of Neptune (e<SUB>N</SUB> â‰² 0.03) do not explain KBOs with semimajor axes 50 < a < 60 au, perihelion distances q > 35 au, and inclinations i < 10Â°.
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::33:::40:::Better results are obtained when Neptune's eccentricity is excited to e<SUB>N</SUB> â‰ƒ 0.1 and subsequently damped by dynamical friction.
UAT:::1096:::Neptune:::120:::127:::These results give support to a (mild) dynamical instability that presumably excited the orbits of giant planets during Neptune's early migration.

UAT:::498:::Planets:::65:::72:::Numerous studies in the past have confirmed that high-mass giant planets are commonly found around metal-rich stars, while the stellar hosts of low-mass planets have a wide range of metallicity.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::81:::88:::We correlate the stellar abundance trends for Î±- and iron-peak elements with the planets' mass.
UAT:::498:::Planets:::182:::189:::We find the planet mass-abundance correlation to be primarily negative for Î±-elements and marginally positive or zero for the iron-peak elements, indicating that stars hosting giant planets are relatively younger.
