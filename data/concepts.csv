http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1054;Milky Way Galaxy;A spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/976;Lunar transient phenomena;A short-lived change in the brightness of patches on the face of the Moon. The TLPs last from a few seconds to a few hours and can grow from less than a few to a hundred kilometers in size. They have been reported by many observers since the invention of the telescope. However, the physical mechanism responsible for creating a TLP is not well understood. Several theories have been proposed, among which lunar outgassing, that is, gas being released from the surface of the Moon.

This gas consists primarily of neutral hydrogen and is thought to have originated from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as a result of tidal interactions with the Milky Way.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992;Magnetars;A highly magnetized neutron star with fields a thousand times stronger than those of radio pulsars. There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1041;Meteors;A streak of light caused when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere and becomes incandescent, mostly from friction with the air at high speed. Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds (11-72 km/s). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge (morning side) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge (evening side). In general, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover, the numbers of random, or sporadic, meteors vary from season to season, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951;Lunar eclipses;The darkening of the Moon which occurs when the Moon enters the umbra of the Earth's shadow. This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/541;Flash spectra;The spectrum of the solar chromosphere obtained during a solar eclipse in the instant before or after totality. In the flash spectrum the usual solar absorption lines are replaced with bright emission lines. This is because in that very short interval only the photosphere is eclipsed by the Moon, and not the chromosphere. The American astronomer Charles A. Young was the first to observe it during the solar eclipse of 1870 (December 22) in Spain.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1096;Neptune;The eighth planet from the Sun and the fourth largest by size in the solar system. The equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km (3.883 Earths), its semi-major axis is 30.11 astronomical units (4.50 x 10^9 km), and its orbital period is 164.8 yr. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest ones are Triton, Proteus, and Nereid, whereas its smaller moons are: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso. Neptune has an incredibly thick atmosphere comprised of 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and approximately 1% methane. Particles of icy methane in its upper atmosphere give Neptune its deep blue color. Large storms whirl through Neptune's upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 m/s, fastest recorded in the solar system. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. Called the Great Dark Spot, it lasted about five years. Neptune has a very thin collection of rings. They are likely made up of ice particles mixed with dust grains and possibly coated with a carbon-based substance.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/526;Fanaroff-Riley radio galaxies;Analyzing a sample of 57 radio galaxies from the 3CR catalogue, which were clearly resolved at 1.4 GHz or 5 GHz, Fanaroff & Riley (1974) discovered that the relative positions of regions of high and low surface brightness in the lobes of extragalactic radio sources are correlated with their radio luminosity. They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures. The physical cause of the FR-I/II dichotomy probably lies in the type of flow in the radio jets.

The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two "embryonic" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59Â±0.09 (statistical) Â±0.54 (systematic) kpc.

LMXBs mainly emit soft X-rays. The ratio of their optical to X-ray luminosities is less than 0.1. They belong to old stellar populations with ages 5-15 x 10^9 years and are found in globular clusters and in the bulge of our Milky Way galaxy; some are also found in the disk. Hercules X-1 is an example of LMXBs.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1918;Wavelet analysis;A refinement of Fourier analysis which enables to simplify the description of a complicated function in terms of a small number of coefficients. The formal history of wavelet theory began in the early 1980s when Jean Morlet, a French geophysicist, introduced the concept of wavelet and studied wavelet transform as a new tool for scientific signal analysis. In 1984, his collaboration with Alex Grossmann yielded a detailed mathematical study of the continuous wavelet transforms and their various applications. Although similar results had already been obtained 20-50 years earlier by several other researchers, the rediscovery of the old concepts provided a new method for decomposing functions.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/940;Low surface brightness galaxies;A member of a particularly faint population of galaxies with a central surface brightness below the brightness of the background sky. The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars. Spiral LSBGs do not obey Freeman's law.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/941;Luminosity classification;A classification of stellar spectra according to luminosity for a given spectral type. The luminosity class is an indication of a star's surface gravity. It is shown by a Roman numeral as follows: I (supergiants), II (bright giants), III (normal giants), IV (subgiants), and V (dwarf stars, or main-sequence stars). Luminosity classes VI (subdwarfs) and VII (white dwarfs) are rarely used. Subclasses a, b, and c are especially used for supergiants, while the most luminous hypergiants are assigned luminosity class Ia-0.

The Moon always keeps the same side toward the Earth, but due to libration, 59% of the Moon's surface can be seen over a period of time. This results from three kinds of libration working in combination: libration in longitude, libration in latitude, and diurnal libration.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/929;Local Group;A small galaxy cluster of about 50 galaxies to which our Milky Way galaxy belongs. The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound. Another remarkable member of the Group is IC 10.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920;LIGO;A facility dedicated to the detection and measurement of cosmic gravitational waves. It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921;Limb brightening;An observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922;Limb darkening;An apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1511;Solar neutrinos;A neutrino generated in the Sun. The main source of solar neutrinos is the proton-proton chain of reactions, in which an energy of +28 MeV is shared between the reaction products. These are called low-energy neutrinos. There are less important reactions in the Sun yielding a smaller flux of higher energy neutrinos. The solar neutrino flux can be estimated from the solar luminosity.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1510;Solar neutrino problem;A major discrepancy between the flux of neutrinos detected at Earth from the solar core and that predicted by current models of solar nuclear fusion and our understanding of neutrinos themselves. The problem, lasting from the mid-1960s to about 2002, was a considerably lesser detected number of neutrons compared with theoretical predictions. The discrepancy has since been resolved by new understanding of neutrino physics, requiring a modification of the standard model of particle physics, in particular neutrino oscillation.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1518;Solar photosphere;The visible surface of the Sun (temperature 5700 K), just below the chromosphere and just above the convective zone. The solar photosphere is a thin layer of roughly 300 km wide. Its temperature decreases uniformly with height, from about 6,600 K (pressure 0.868 millibars) at its bottom, to about 4,400 K (pressure 125 mb), where it merges with the chromosphere. The photosphere has a 'rice-grain' appearance, called granulation, caused by rising (hot) and falling (cool) material in the convective cells just below the photosphere. Other main features of the photosphere are sunspots, faculae, and supergranulation.

The same phenomenon also produces the zodiacal light, much farther away from the Sun. The dust particles are at most several microns in size and make up a disk stretching over almost 1 solar radius (700,000 km) from the Sun's surface. Unlike electrons, which are responsible for the K corona, the dust particles move relatively slowly. Thus, the light scattered by them has the same spectrum as the photosphere and shows the Fraunhofer lines. The F corona is the most luminous part of the corona at 1.5 solar radii from the Sun's surface.

Understanding how the solar magnetic field comes about is the fundamental problem of Solar Physics. The solar magnetic field is responsible for all solar magnetic phenomena, such as sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and the solar wind. The solar magnetic fields are observed from the Zeeman broadening of spectral lines, polarization effects on radio emission, and from the channeling of charged particles into visible coronal streamers. The strength of Sun's average magnetic field is 1 gauss (twice the average field on the surface of Earth, around 0.5 gauss), and can be as strong as 4,000 Gauss in the neighborhood of a large sunspot.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1570;Starburst galaxies;A galaxy showing a short-lived intense period of star formation that is unsustainable over the Hubble time due to the limited supply of gas within a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were first classified by Searle & Sargent (1972) and Searle et al. (1973), based on the blue colors produced by the massive stars formed during the burst. In the local Universe, starbursts create approximately 10% of the radiant energy and 20% of the massive stars. At z = 1, starburst characteristics are found in 15% of galaxies, presumably attributable to the greater amounts of gas typically present in young galaxies and increased galactic interactions. The starburst's impact on a galaxy and the surrounding intergalactic medium is primarily due to the consumption of gas that fuels the burst and the feedback from massive stars formed in the burst.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1568;Star counts;The number of stars that appear in a given region of sky, usually counted on a photographic plate or CCD image.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/467;Equatorial coordinate system;An astronomical coordinate system for indicating the positions of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. The system consists of two components, right ascension and declination. Right ascension is the angle between the vernal equinox and the point where the hour circle intersects the celestial equator. The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0Â°. Equatorial coordinates change with time due to the precession of the Earth's rotation axis.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1567;Star clusters;A group of stars held together by the mutual gravitational attraction of its members, which are physically related through common origin. They are of two types: open clusters and globular clusters.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/440;Eccentric anomaly;Of a planetary orbit, the angle measured from the perihelion position, to the center of the circumscribing auxiliary circle, to the projected position of the planet on the circle.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/441;Eccentricity;The amount by which the orbit deviates from circularity: e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a the semi-major axis. If e = 0, the orbit is a circle. If e < 1, the orbit is an ellipse, if e > 1 it is a hyperbola, and if e = 1 it is a parabola. The eccentricity is one of the six orbital elements that define a Keplerian orbit.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/442;Eclipses;The passage of the shadow of a celestial body over the surface of another. The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).

These systems include star clusters, globular clusters, and galaxies. Stellar dynamics deals with systems in which each member contributes importantly to the overall gravitational field and is usually concerned with the statistical properties of many orbits. It can be compared to the kinetic theory of gases developed in the late 19th century. In contrast, celestial mechanics deals with systems where the gravitational force of a massive planet or star determines the orbits of its satellites.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/439;Earth (planet);The third planet from the Sun. At perihelion, it is 147,099,590 km from the Sun, and at aphelion it is 152,096.150 km, whereas its mean distance from the Sun (astronomical unit) is 149,598 x 10^6 km. Its orbital period is 365.2563 days (sidereal year) and its eccentricity 0.017. Other characteristics: axial inclination 23.44Â°; rotation period 23.934 h (sidereal day); mean density 5.52 g/cm^3; mass 5.974 x 10^24 kg; escape velocity 11.18 km/s; average albedo 0.37.  The Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.9% argon, plus carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and other gases in much smaller quantities. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 1,000 mbar. The surface average temperature is 15Â° C, but it varies, on the average, between -50Â° C (winter, Siberia) and up to + 40Â° C (summer, Sahara).  Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858;Intracluster medium;A diffuse, hot, magnetized plasma that exists between galaxies in a galaxy cluster and is composed mainly of H, He, and heavy elements. The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred).

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/853;Interstellar reddening;The dimming of light during its travel in the interstellar medium due to absorption by intervening dust grains. Since shorter wavelengths are particularly affected, the spectrum of the light is increasingly dominated by the long wavelength end of the spectrum. As a result, the light is 'reddened' as it travels through space. Robert J. Trumpler (1886-1956), a Swiss-American astronomer, was the first to produce a definite evidence of the existence of interstellar extinction and to estimate its magnitude (1930).

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/420;Dwarf spheroidal galaxies;A subtype of dwarf ellipticals (dwarf elliptical galaxy), which are companion to the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. The first example of such objects was discovered by Harlow Shapley (1938) in the constellation Sculptor. 22 such galaxies are known currently to orbit the Milky Way and at least 36 exist in the Local Group of galaxies. Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible. Many of the Local Group dSph galaxies show evidence for star formation more recent than 10 Gyr.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/418;Dwarf novae;A class of novae and cataclysmic variables that have multiple observed eruptions. Their prototype is U Geminorum star. Optically, dwarf nova eruptions have amplitudes of 2-6 mag in V, a duration of a few to 20 days and a recurrence time-scale of weeks to years. Dwarf novae are thought to be semidetached binary stars consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting via Roche lobe overflow from a companion which is usually a late-type, generally main-sequence star. DN outbursts are usually attributed to the release of gravitational energy resulting from an instability in the accretion disk or by sudden mass transfers through the disk.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/419;Dwarf planets;A new category of astronomical objects in the solar system introduced in a resolution by the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24, 2006. The characterizing properties are as follows: 1) It is in orbit around the Sun; 2) It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape; 3) It has not 'cleared the neighbourhood' around its orbit; and 4) It is not a satellite of a planet, or other non-stellar body. The property 3 reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet because it has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit (the Kuiper Belt). The largest known dwarf planets are: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, and 2015 RR245.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/415;Dwarf elliptical galaxies;A galaxy that is much smaller than other members of the elliptical class; it is designated as dE. A subtype of dwarf ellipticals is called a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). The basic characteristics of the class are low surface brightness and smooth light distribution. They range in luminosity from that of the faintest dSph galaxies M_V ~ -9 to about -17. In the Local Group there are 19 known dEs. They are very common in galaxy clusters.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/416;Dwarf galaxies;A small, low luminosity galaxy that is associated with a larger spiral galaxy and may make up part of a galactic halo. There are many of them in the Local Group, and often orbit around larger galaxies such as the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. There are three main types of them: dwarf elliptical galaxy (dE), dwarf irregular galaxy (dI), and dwarf spiral galaxy (dSA).
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/417;Dwarf irregular galaxies;An irregular galaxy that is much smaller than other irregulars. Dwarf irregulars are generally metal poor and have relatively high fractions of gas.

L dwarfs are intermediate in temperature between M and T dwarfs. Their spectra in the optical show weak titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) absorption lines and strong metallic hydrides CrH (8611 and 9969 Ã) and FeH (8692 and 9896 Ã).

A third, less massive body, located at any one of these points, will be held in equilibrium with respect to the other two. Three of the points, L1, L2, and L3, lie on a line joining the centers of M and m. L1 lies between M and m, near to m, L2 lies beyond m, and L3 on the other side of M beyond the orbit. The other two points, L4 and L5, which are the most stable, lie on either side of this line, in the orbit of m around M, each of them making an equilateral triangle with M and m. L4 lies in the m's orbit approximately 60Â° ahead of it, while L5 lies in the m's orbit approximately 60Â° behind m.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/422;Dynamical friction;The gravitational interaction between a relatively massive body and a field of much less massive bodies through which the massive body travels. As a result, the moving body loses momentum and kinetic energy. An example of dynamical friction is the sinking of massive stars to the center of a star cluster, a process called mass segregation. Dynamical friction plays an important role in stellar dynamics. It was first quantified by Chandrasekhar (1943).
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/423;Dynamical parallax;A method for deriving the distance to a binary star.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882;Kappa mechanism;A process based on the effects of opacity (Îº) that drives the pulsations of many types of variable stars. Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high Îº region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The Îº mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873;Jupiter;The largest planet in the Solar System and the fifth from the Sun, lying at a mean distance of about 5.2 astronomical units from the Sun. Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1810;X-ray astronomy;The study of celestial bodies using their X-ray emission. X-ray astronomy deals mainly with Galactic and extragalactic phenomena involving very high-energy photon emissions, covering a band of energies between 0.1 keV and 500 keV. The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere. The first rocket flight which successfully detected a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by an American research group. A very bright source was detected that they named Scorpius X-1. Since then several dedicated X-ray astronomy satellites have been launched, among which: Uhuru, INTEGRAL, ROSAT, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), Chandra X-ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton, which have contributed to important advances in astronomy.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1811;X-ray binary stars;A binary star system where one of the stars has evolved and collapsed into an extremely dense body such as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. The enormous gravitational attraction of the massive, dense, but dim component pulls material from the brighter, less massive star in an accretion disk. The gravitational potential energy of the accreted matter is converted to heat by viscosity and eventually to high-energy photons in the X-ray range. The brightest X-ray binary is Scorpius X-1.

More specifically, when a sunspot approaches the solar limbs the width of the penumbra, relative to the umbra, on the side facing the center of the Sun seems to become narrower than on the side facing the limb. This phenomenon arises from a projection effect, and is due to a geometrical depression (the Wilson depression) in the layers of constant optical depth in sunspots.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1804;Winter solstice;The moment in the northern hemisphere when the Sun attains its lowest declination of -23Â°26' (or -23Â°.44) with respect the equator plane. It happens when the Earth's axis is orientated directly away from the Sun, on 21 or 22 December. During the northern winter solstice the Sun appears to be directly overhead at noon for places situated at latitude 23.44 degrees south, known as the tropic of Capricorn. The winter solstice can occur at any moment during the day. Two successive winter solstices are shifted in time by about 6 h. The winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1828;Yellow hypergiant stars;An evolved, very massive star of spectral type F or G with a very high luminosity (~10^5 times solar) lying near the empirical upper luminosity boundary in the H-R diagram (Humphreys-Davidson limit). Yellow hypergiants have high mass loss rates (10^-5 - 10^-3 solar masses per year) and are in a short, transitional evolutionary stage. Their evolutionary state is thought to correspond to post-red supergiants rapidly evolving in blueward loops in the H-R diagram. In their post-RSG blueward evolution these stars enter a temperature range (6000-9000 K), called yellow void, with increased dynamical instability. Their link to other advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars such as Luminous Blue Variables and Wolf-Rayet stars is still an open issue in stellar evolution theory. The most famous yellow hypergiant is Rho Cassiopeiae.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1852;X-ray transient sources;An X-ray source that enhances its emission well above its usual level for a period typically longer than a week. Recurrences can be periodic or aperiodic, but there is no obvious correlation between recurrence time and the luminosity amplitude of the outburst. X-ray transients seem to be divided into two classes: those associated with high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) stars and those associated with low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) stars. The HMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole paired with a massive star. Often, the stellar companion is a Be star, Be star, which sometimes sheds material from its equatorial region. In these systems, the transient event is characterized by having more higher energy X-rays in the spectrum. The LMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole orbiting around a cooler, low-mass star. These transient events often generate more lower-energy X-rays.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/93;Astronomical sextants;An instrument used mainly in nautical astronomy to determine the angular distances of celestial bodies above the horizon. The sextant consists of a 60Â° graduated arc, or limb, a small telescope, and two mirrors. Only half of one of the mirrors, the horizon glass, is silvered and, like the telescope, it is fastened to the frame supporting the limb. The other mirror, the index mirror, moves with an index arm pivoted at the center of the arc. The index arm is equipped with a vernier which moves along the limb. An object in direction S can be observed in the telescope through the un-silvered portion of the horizon glass. By moving the index arm, the second object S' is made to coincide with S in the telescope. According to the law of reflection, the angle between S and S' is double the angle between the mirrors. The angular distance between the objects can therefore be obtained from the measurement of angles between the planes of the mirrors.

With an eccentricity of 0.05555, its distance from the Sun ranges from 1.35 billion km (9.024 AU) at its perihelion to 1.509 billion km (10.086 AU) at its aphelion. Its average orbital speed being 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. Saturn has a mass of 5.6836 x 1026 kg (95.159 Earth masses) and a mean density of 0.687 g cm^(-3). Like Jupiter, Saturn is about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with traces of water, methane, and ammonia, similar to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the solar system was formed. The temperature on Saturn is ~ -185 Â°C. Like Jupiter, Saturn has a solid core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). The core has an estimated mass of 9-22 Earth Masses and a diameter of about 25,000 km (about 2 Earth diameter). The core is enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer. Saturn's interior is hot (12,000 K at the core). The planet radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Most of the extra energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism as in Jupiter. Saturn has 62 known satellites.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1451;Shepherd satellites;A natural satellite in orbit near the edge of a planetary ring, whose gravitational force on the ring particles strongly controls the distribution of material within the ring, creating ringlets and density waves within the ring and sharp edges at ring boundaries. Examples include Saturn's Prometheus and Pandora, which shepherd the narrow outer F ring and the Uranus satellites Cordelia and Ophelia and the epsilon ring. The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits. At the same time the slower-moving outer satellite decelerates the outer ring particles as they pass by, causing them to spiral inward. The result is a narrow, well-defined ring.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1450;Shell burning;The nuclear reactions in a shell around a star's core that continue after the fuel in the core itself has been exhausted. As the fuel is progressively exhausted, the shell moves outward until it enters regions too cool for the reactions to continue. For example, after the exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, helium burning might take place in the core with a shell of hydrogen burning surrounding it. Stars may have more than one region of shell burning during their stellar evolution, each shell with its own nuclear reactions.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/351;Dark energy;A hypothetical form of energy that fills all the space and tends to increase the rate of expansion of the Universe. Assuming the existence of dark energy is a way to explain recent observations that the Universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative.  The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are: baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant and exotic component such as quintessence.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/353;Dark matter;Matter that has no radiation and therefore cannot be detected directly, but whose presence can be inferred from dynamical phenomena produced by its gravitational influence. The existence of dark matter is deduced mainly from the rotational speeds of galaxies, velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter plays also a central role in cosmic structure formation. There exists a large number of non-baryonic dark matter candidates. They include, the hypothetical stable particles WIMPs, neutralinos, axions, gravitinos, etc. Among unstable candidates are gravitinos with mild R-parity violation and sterile neutrinos.

Periods lie in the range from 20 to more than 2000 days, while the shapes of the light curve may be rather different and variable with each cycle. The amplitudes may be from several hundredths to several magnitudes (usually 1-2 magnitudes in the V filter). Examples are Betelgeuse, Antares, and Rasalgethi. Semiregular variables are classified in several subtypes: SRA, SRB, SRC, and SRD.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/52;Interstellar objects;A body other than a star or substellar object not gravitationally bound to a star. Its hyperbolic orbit would indicate an object not bound to the Sun. The first known ISO is 1I/'Oumuamua. ISOs are icy planetesimals that are expected to behave like the long-period comets of the solar system; volatile ices sublimate when the ISO approaches the Sun, developing a coma and a dust tail -- features that should make them bright and therefore easy to spot. The rocky ISOs, on the other hand, only reflect sunlight. As their albedo is expected to be extremely low they become dark (after eons of bombardment by high-energy cosmic rays), they would be extremely faint and hard to detect.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1447;Seyfert galaxies;A member of an important class of active galaxies which are characterized by the presence of an intensely bright nucleus in the optical wavelengths (10^9-10^12 L_sun) displaying emission spectral lines. The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798;Instability strip;A narrow, almost vertical, band on the right hand side of the main sequence in the H-R diagram occupied by many different types of pulsating stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheids, W Virginis, ZZ Ceti). Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/73;Asteroseismology;The study of the internal structure of stars through the interpretation of their pulsation periods (stellar pulsation). The radial pulsations are the result of sound waves resonating in the stars interior. Different pulsation modes penetrate to different depths inside a star. If a large number of pulsation modes occurs, then the stellar interior, which is not directly observable, can be probed from oscillation studies because the modes penetrate to various depths inside the star. Using a complex mathematical analysis, very detailed investigations of the structure of the star's interior can be carried out. Applied to the Sun, it is called helioseismology.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/329;Cosmic rays;Extremely energetic atomic nuclei which travel through the Universe at practically the speed of light and strike the Earth from all direction. Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays. Their energy ranges from 10^9 to 10^20 electron-volts.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/380;Diffuse interstellar clouds;An interstellar cloud in which hydrogen is completely dissociated and which is less dense and dusty than molecular clouds. In diffuse interstellar clouds photoabsorption of the background ultraviolet (UV) radiation field is an important dissociating and ionizing process. Typical densities and temperatures of diffuse clouds are 10^2 to 10^3 cm^-3 and 20 to 100 K respectively. Because of modest extinctions (â¤ 1 mag), photodissociation processes are important in diffuse clouds preventing the formation of larger molecules.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/381;Diffuse molecular clouds;A type of molecular cloud in which the interstellar radiation field is sufficiently attenuated, so that the local fraction of molecular hydrogen becomes substantial (> 0.1). However, enough interstellar radiation is still present to photoionize any atomic carbon, or to photodissociate carbon monoxide (CO) such that carbon is predominantly still in the form of C+ (> 0.5). In steady state, diffuse molecular clouds must necessarily be surrounded by diffuse atomic gas, in order to provide the shielding of radiation. This means that most sightlines that cross a diffuse molecular cloud will also cross diffuse atomic gas.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1015;Maunder minimum;A period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low. This solar activity minimum is attested also through the increased content of carbon-14 in tree rings in that period. The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age. The Maunder minimum is one of a number of periods of low solar activity, including the Dalton minimum, the Sporer minimum, the Wolf minimum, and the Oort minimum.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/16;Active galactic nuclei;A central region of an active galaxy, which is a light-year or less in diameter and has an abnormally high luminosity. The nucleus emits high energy radiation (gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet) and shows variability over various time-scales, sometimes very short (hours to weeks). Emission line spectra reveal high velocity motions up to 10^4 km s^-1. AGNs are divided into two main types. Type I refers to an AGN whose nucleus is visible (the spectra has both narrow and broad emission lines), while in type II AGN, the broad line region (BLR) is obscured and the lines are very narrow. This may be due either to the viewing angle or some intrinsic difference in structure.

There are several types of active galaxies: Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars. All of these objects show brightness variations, some as short as 3 hours. These fluctuations indicate a relatively very small size for the central object, because an object cannot vary in brightness faster than light can travel across it. For example, an object that is one light-year in diameter cannot vary significantly in brightness over a period of less than one year.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1485;Solar coronal loops;An arc-like structure in the Sun's corona that is found around sunspots and in active regions. These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. The loops are sometimes as high as 10,000 km with their two ends situated in photosphere regions of opposite magnetic polarity. This implies that the coronal loops are tubes of magnetic flux filled with hot plasma. They last for days or weeks but most change quite rapidly.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1484;Solar coronal holes;An area in the solar corona which appears dark in X-rays and ultraviolet light. The gas density in these areas are very low, about 100 times less than that of coronal active regions. The magnetic field lines in a coronal hole extend out into interplanetary space rather than returning to the Sun's surface, as they do in other parts of the Sun (open magnetic field line). Ionized hot gas can escape easily along such a path, and this brings about high speed solar wind streams.

Two tiny satellites (Phobos and Deimos), both of which are locked in synchronous rotation with Mars.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/14;Accretion;The process by which an object increases its mass under the influence of its gravitational attraction. Accretion plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In particular stars result from the accretion of material by a protostar from a surrounding molecular cloud. The accumulation of mass on the protostar involves the formation of an accretion disk. Theoretical and observational investigations of protostars and newborn stars indicate the important role of magnetic fields in this process. They favor the magnetospheric accretion model for mass transfer from the circumstellar disk onto the newborn star. In this model, the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk at a few stellar radii. Gas from the disk accretes onto the star along the magnetic field lines and hits the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity, causing a strong accretion shock. Various emission lines are formed in the infalling magnetospheric flow. Moreover, optical/ultraviolet excess continuum emission is produced in the accretion shocks. The accretion is accompanied by mass ejection through collimated bipolar jets.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1034;Meteor showers;An increased number of meteors all appearing to diverge from the direction of a single point, called radiant. Meteor showers occur annually on the same dates, when the Earth crosses through a meteoroid stream. Meteor showers are named after the constellation in which the radiant is located. For example, the Perseids's radiant lies near the top of the constellation Perseus. Most meteor showers are caused by comets. As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions, during a meteor storm, thousands of meteors fall per hour. Prominent meteor showers are: Quadrantids, Lyrids, Eta Aquariids, Delta Aquariids, Perseids, Orionids, Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Alpha Capricornids.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1031;Metallicity;In a star, nebula, or galaxy, the proportion of the material that is made up of metals, that is elements heavier than helium. It is generally denoted by Z. The term 'metallicity' is a misnomer used in astrophysics.  In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 Â± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction.  Nebular metallicity is often defined as the relative abundance of oxygen: (NO/NH)neb/(NO/NH)Sun, where N_O and N_H represent the numbers of oxygen and hydrogen atoms per unit volume.

Same as heliocentric parallax.  Because the Earth revolves around the Sun, we observe the sky from a constantly moving position in space. Therefore, we should expect to see an annual effect, in which the positions of nearby objects appear to oscillate back and forth in response to our motion around the Sun. This does in fact happen, but the distances to even the nearest stars are so great that we need to make careful observations with a telescope to detect it. The annual parallax of the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 0.762 arcsec, which is too small for our acuity of vision.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1025;Mercury-manganese stars;Chemically peculiar stars of late B-types. The most distinctive features of Mercury-manganese stars are extreme atmospheric overabundance of Hg (up to 5 dex) and of Mn (up to 3 dex). The origin of abundance anomalies observed in late B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity is still poorly understood. More than two thirds of the HgMn stars are known to belong to spectroscopic binaries with a preference of orbital periods ranging from 3 to 20 days.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024;Mercury (planet);The closest planet to the Sun and one of five planets visible with the naked eye. The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28Â°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427Â°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173Â°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.

The prototype, AM Canum Venaticorum, with a period of 17 minutes, was discovered in 1967. AM CVn stars are semidetached binary systems in which accretion is going on. The donor star is hydrogen deficient and the accretor is usually a white dwarf. To fit within their Roche lobes, the donor stars must be dense, suggesting they may be degenerate too. It is at present thought that AM CVn stars represent three possible evolutionary phases in 1) double white dwarf systems, 2) white dwarf and helium star binaries, and 3) cataclysmic variables with evolved donors.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/367;Degenerate matter;Highly compressed matter in which the normal atomic structure has broken down and which, because of quantum-mechanical effects, exerts a pressure that is independent of temperature. Bodies with masses less than Chandrasekhar's limit (1.4 solar masses) are supported by electron degeneracy pressure and have densities of about 10^6 kg/m^3. In collapsed stars of mass above 1.4 solar masses, gravity will overwhelm electron degeneracy and further collapse ensues. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, so producing a neutron star. Because neutrons, like electrons, are fermions and therefore subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, at high enough densities, about 10^14 kg/m^3, neutron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse of the star. For masses larger than 2-3 solar masses, even neutron degeneracy cannot prevent further collapse, and a black hole is formed.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/368;Delta Cepheid variable stars;The prototype of classical Cepheid variables, which is a pulsating yellow supergiant. John Goodricke was the first in 1784 to discover its variability. The star shows a quick and sharp rise from minimum to maximum, and slowly declines to its minimum again. The changes in brightness are accompanied by and principally caused by changes in stellar temperature and also by changes in radius. Î´ Cephei was actually the second Cepheid variable to be discovered. The first one, Eta Aquilae, had been discovered earlier the same year by Edward Pigott. Î´ Cephei varies with a period of 5.366341 days (or 5 days 8 hours 37.5 minutes) from magnitude 3.48, spectral type F5 Ib in its maximum to magnitude 4.37, spectral type G2 Ib in its minimum. It lies at a distance of 1,340 light-years.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732;Massive stars;A star whose mass is larger than approximately 10 solar masses. The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1286;Position angle;The convention for measuring angles on the sky in astronomy (abbreviated as PA). It is the direction of an imaginary arrow in the sky, measured from north through east: 0Â° = north, 90Â° = east, 180Â° = south, and so on to 359Â° and back to 0Â°. Applied to a binary system it is the direction of a secondary body or feature from a primary, measured in the system.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1285;Population III stars;A member of the first generation of stars, formed out of pristine gas, enriched by primordial nucleosynthesis alone. The material from which these stars formed consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. Because neutral hydrogen clouds were free of dust, their cooling mechanism was drastically ineffective. As a result, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore, these first generation of stars were principally massive, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation, namely Population II. Some models predict a bimodal initial mass function for the first stars, allowing also for solar mass stars.

When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The dominant volatile is water, followed by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water) and many other molecules at a lower level.

It is bounded by the heliopause, which is estimated to be 100 astronomical units or more from the Sun. The radius of the heliosphere is expected to vary with the solar cycle. The heliosphere may be very elongated owing to the presence of an interstellar wind of neutral hydrogen flowing from the direction of the Galactic center.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2164;Ultraluminous x-ray sources;An X-ray source that is not in the nucleus of a galaxy, and is more luminous than 10^39 ergs s^-1, brighter than the Eddington luminosity of a 10 solar mass black hole. In general, there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs. The Milky Way contains no such objects. ULXs are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, onto stellar black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10^3 - 10^5 solar masses). NGC 1313X-1, NGC 5408X-1, and NGC 6946X-1 are three ULXs with X-ray luminosities up to ~10^40 erg s^-1.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/725;Hertzsprung Russell diagram;A display of stellar properties using a plot of effective temperature (or instead color or spectral type) along the abscissa versus luminosity (or absolute magnitude). The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.

Its earliest recorded sighting is traced back to 240 BC in China. In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758. Halley's comet is the first known periodic comet, hence its designation 1P/Halley.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2186;Titan;The largest and the sixth moon of Saturn discovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 Â°C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2187;Triton;The seventh and the largest of Neptune's satellites. It has a diameter of 2,700 km and orbits its planet at a mean distance of 354,760 km every 5.877 days. Triton was discovered by William Lassell in 1846 scarcely a month after Neptune was discovered. Triton is colder than any other measured object in the solar system with a surface temperature of -235Â° C. It has an extremely thin atmosphere. Nitrogen ice particles might form thin clouds a few kilometers above the surface. The atmospheric pressure at Triton's surface is about 15 microbars, 0.000015 times the sea-level surface pressure on Earth. Triton is the only large satellite in the solar system to circle a planet in a retrograde motion, that is in a direction opposite to the rotation of the planet.

It was discovered by Galileo and Marius in 1610. The mean surface temperature of Ganymede is -160 Â°C. It is the only moon known to have a magnetosphere.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2189;Europa;The sixth of Jupiter's known moons and the fourth largest; it is the second of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 Ã 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 Â°C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 Â°C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776;Hypervelocity stars;A star whose velocity is so great that it will escape the gravitational potential of our Galaxy. Depending on the location and direction of motion, this criterion typically corresponds to a stellar velocity in the Galactic rest frame larger than 400 km s^-1, and up to about 1200 km s^-1. The nature of the hypervelocity stars  (HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310;Solar coronal mass ejections;A huge eruption of material from regions of the solar corona in which the magnetic field is closed, but which suffer an extremely energetic disruption. Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/757;Hubble classification scheme;The classification of galaxies according to their visual appearance into four basic types suggested by E. Hubble: ellipticals (E), spirals (S), barred spirals (SB), and irregulars (Ir). Later on a separate class of lenticulars (S0) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies (E0). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio (a - b)/a, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories (E0, E1, ..., E7). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular (S0) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure: ordinary spirals, S, and barred spirals, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa, Sb, Sc, and SBa, SBb, SBc, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc, the central bulge becomes smaller, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/758;Hubble constant;The Hubble parameter for the present epoch. It is the constant of proportionality between the recession velocities of galaxies and their distances from each other. The latest determinations using the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheids give H_0 = 72 Â± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the WMAP observations yield 70.4 Â± 1.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and the Planck Satellite observations give 67.3 Â± 1.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. More recently, the Hubble constant was derived by a team of astronomers, using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4% accuracy. The new value, 73.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, suggests that the Universe is expanding between five and nine percent faster than previously calculated. The Hubble law is only applicable for large distances (> 20 Mpc), when the proper motions of galaxies in groups and clusters cannot confuse the recession due to expansion.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2190;Io;The fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3630 km, Io is slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It revolves at a mean distance of 422,000 km from Jupiter. Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 Â°C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out. Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/768;Hydrogen burning;A series of thermonuclear reactions, taking place mainly in low-mass stars, such as the Sun, which transforms four hydrogen nuclei (protons) into one helium (Helium-4) nucleus and thereby generates energy in the stellar core. First, two protons (Helium-1) combine to form a deuterium nucleus (Helium-2) with the emission of a positron and a neutrino.  The deuterium nucleus then rapidly captures another proton to form a Helium-3 nucleus, while emitting a gamma ray. There are three alternatives for the next step. In the proton-proton chain, occurring in 86% of the cases, two Helium-3 nuclei fuse to a final Helium-4 nucleus while two protons are released. The mass of the resulting Helium-4 nucleus is less than the total mass of the four original protons. The difference, ~ 0.7% of the total mass of the protons, is converted into energy and radiated by the Sun. In this process, the Sun loses some 4 million tons of its mass each second.

The surface of the Sun vibrates much like a bell. A piano has 88 keys or musical tones, whereas the Sun has millions of notes. These vibrations are the result of internal pressure waves that reflect off the photosphere and repeatedly cross the solar interior. They are detected through the Doppler shift of absorption lines formed in the photosphere. Because these vibrations make the solar surface move up and down, analysis of the surface patterns is used to study conditions far below the Sun's surface. The mean period of the vibrations is about five minutes, which corresponds to a frequency of about 3 mHz.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/704;Hayashi track;The path on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is followed by a fully convective pre-main sequence star to reach the zero-age main sequence.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/703;Hawking radiation;The radiation produced by a black hole when quantum mechanical effects are taken into account. According to quantum physics, large fluctuations in the vacuum energy occurs for brief moments of time. Thereby virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are created from vacuum and annihilated. If pair production happens just outside the event horizon of a black hole, as soon as these particles are formed they would both experience drastically different gravitational attractions due to the sharp gradient of force close to the black hole. One particle will accelerate toward the black hole and its partner will escape into space. The black hole used some of its gravitational energy to produce these two particles, so it loses some of its mass if a particle escapes. This gradual loss of mass over time means the black hole eventually evaporates out of existence.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1734;Ultracompact dwarf galaxies;A type of very bright compact stellar system (-14 â¤ MV â¥ -12) that is intermediate between globular clusters (GCs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs). With masses of M > 2 x 10^6 M_sun and radii > 10 parsecs (pc), UCDs are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. Nevertheless, the nature and origin of these objects is still widely debated. Early interpretations suggested that UCDs could be the most massive GCs or possibly the tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies. However, there is evidence that both formation mechanisms could contribute to the UCD population. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been confirmed in most UCDs with masses M > 10^7 M_sun. The most massive UCD discovered to date, M59-UCD3 (M_* ~2 x 10^8 M_sun, radius ~ 25 pc), hosts a SMBH.

Quasars can also have such high or even higher bolometric luminosities. However LIRGs and ULIRGs emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared. Most of ULIRGs are found in merging and interacting galaxy systems. It is thought that their luminosity results from galactic collisions, which increase the rate of star formation.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1728;Type Ia supernovae;A Type I supernova that presents a singly-ionized silicon (Si II) absorption feature at 6150 Ã near peak brightness. Type Ia SNe are believed to result from mass accretion to a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion. Type Ia supernovae occur in all types of galaxies. Type Ia SNe are used as standard candles in determining cosmological distances, after normalizing their light curves with the Phillips relation.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/280;Comets;A small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice, but also contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water), and many other molecules at a lower level.

Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane. Uranus has a ring system and 27 known satellites.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1752;Urca process;A cycle of nuclear reactions, primarily among the iron group of elements, accompanied by a high rate of neutrino formation. Neutrinos carry away energy quickly leading to the cooling of the stellar core and a dramatic drop in the pressure. Due to this process in pre-supernova stars, the core becomes unable to support the weight of the overlying layers. These layers collapse onto the core and subsequently rebound and escape in the supernova explosion.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1763;Venus;The second planet from the Sun, at a mean distance of roughly 108.21 x 10^6 km (0.72 astronomical units). The greatest elongation of Venus is about 47Â°, making it visible at most about 3 hours after sunset or before sunrise. Venus has the most circular orbit of any planet in the solar system. Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1799;White dwarf stars;A compact star of high surface temperature, low luminosity, and high density (10^5 - 10^8 g cm^-3), with roughly the mass of the Sun (mean mass ~ 0.6 M_sun) and the radius of the Earth (R ~ 0.01 R_sun), representing the end-point of the evolution of all stars with masses less then ~ 5-9 solar masses. A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.

The former transitions are sporadically detected since they are strongly absorbed in the Earth's atmosphere, because of its high water vapor content.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1300;Protoplanetary disks;A circumstellar disk of gas and dust surrounding a pre-main sequence star from which planetary systems form. Protoplanetary disks are remnants of accretion disks which bring forth stars. Typically, their sizes are ~100-500 AU, masses ~10^-2 solar masses, lifetimes ~10^6 - 10^7 years, and accretion rates ~10^-7 - 10^-8 solar masses per year. According to the standard theory of planet formation, called core accretion, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1309;Pulsation modes;The way in which pulsations occur in a star due to the fact that stars act as resonant cavities, as studied in asteroseismology. A star may pulsate either with approximately spherical symmetry (radial pulsation), or as a series of waves running across the surface (non-radial pulsation). Pulsation may occur in a single mode or in multiple modes, depending on the type of star. Three different modes of pulsations have been detected through the helioseismology of the Sun: p mode, g mode, and f mode, generated by acoustic, gravity, and surface gravity waves respectively.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1781;von Zeipel theorem;A theorem that establishes a relation between the radiative flux at some colatitude on the surface of a rotating star and the local effective gravity (which is a function of the angular velocity and colatitude). For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(Î¸) â g_eff (Î¸)Î±, where Î± is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (Î¸) â g_eff (Î¸)Î², where Î² is the gravity darkening exponent. In massive stars this latitudinal dependence of the temperature leads to asymmetric mass loss and also to enhanced average mass loss rates.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1306;Pulsars;A rotating neutron star that emits a radio beam that is centered on the magnetic axis of the neutron star. As the magnetic axis and hence the beam are inclined to the rotation axis, a pulse is seen every time the rotation brings the magnetic pole region of the neutron star into view. In this way the pulsar acts much as a light house does, sweeping a beam of radiation through space. The pulse or spin periods range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds. As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies (0.1-1 GHz), is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar (magnetosphere). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate.

They also exhibit a period-luminosity relation which is distinct, but works in a similar way to the relation for Type I Cepheids.

In addition, during its whole life the photometer was mounted permanently on the same telescope that had been built specifically for this instrument, the 91 cm 'Lightcollector' reflector, which started in 1958 at the Leiden Southern Station in Broederstroom, South-Africa. After 20 years in South-Africa the telescope and photometer were moved to the European Southern Observatory La Silla observatory in Chile.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/218;Cepheid variable stars;A class of luminous, yellow supergiants that are pulsating variables and whose period of variation is a function of their luminosity. These stars expand and contract at extremely regular periods, in the range 1-50 days. Their highest brightness and surface temperature occur when their expansion velocity is greatest. Similarly, their minima in brightness and temperature occur when they are in the contraction phase. The longer the period, the more luminous the star. The process that drives the pulsation of Cepheid variables is the kappa mechanism. In fact, Cepheids provide one of the most powerful tools for measuring distances to other galaxies (period-luminosity relation). However, this method is limited to the distance of the Virgo cluster of galaxies (15-20 Mpc) even with the HST or the largest ground-based telescopes. One particularly special Cepheid is the North Star, Polaris.

Its mass is 9.4 x 10^20 kg, its rotation period 9.074 hours, its orbital period 4.60 years, and its semi-major axis 2.767 AU. NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which was placed in orbit around Ceres in 2015, has mapped its surface in great detail.

Quintessence can have several types and differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In modern physics, the four known "elements" are the baryons (proton, neutron, etc.), the leptons (neutrinos, electrons, etc.), the photon, and the hypothetical non-baryonic matter, which is thought to be 80% of the total matter in the Universe. The quintessence field is a possibility which can be confirmed or disproved by measurements of the dark energy value at different redshifts. In some models, the quintessence is fine-tuned to explain both the cosmological constant problem and the inflation in the very early Universe.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680;Gravity darkening;The darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/678;Gravitational waves;A space-time oscillation created by the motion of matter, as predicted by Einstein's general relativity. When an object accelerates, it creates ripples in space-time, just like a boat causes ripples in a lake. Gravitational waves are extremely weak even for the most massive objects like supermassive black holes. They had been inferred from observing a binary pulsar in which the components slow down, due to losing energy from emitting gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time on September 14, 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Since then several other events have been detected by LIGO and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

H II regions originate when O or early-type stars, born in giant molecular clouds, start heating up the cold gas, causing it to become ionized and 'glow'. The effective temperatures of the exciting stars are in the range 3 x 10^4 to 5 x 10^4 K, and throughout the nebula hydrogen is ionized. Helium is singly ionized, and other elements are mostly singly or doubly ionized. Typical densities in the H II region are of the order 10 to 10^2 cm^-3, ranging as high as 10^4 cm^-3. Internal motions occur in the gas with velocities of order 10 km s^-1.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1373;Red sequence galaxies;nan
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1372;Red giant stars;A certain star of spectral type K or later that occupies the upper right portion of the H-R diagram. Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel in the core. They may have a luminosity up to 1000 times greater than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. Red giants belong to the luminosity class III or II (bright giants). They are luminous because of their great size, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium, nuclear reactions in the core stop (SchÃ¶nberg-Chandrasekhar limit). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size (from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100,000,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus.

Circumstellar envelopes result from mass loss from the central star (10-7 to 10-4 solar masses per year) and expand with moderate velocities (10 to 15 km sec^-1). The low temperature of the envelope is at the origin of the formation of molecules, which in certain conditions provide maser emission (H_{2}O, OH, SiO).

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2028;Cooling flows;A phenomenon observed in a cluster of galaxies, whereby the cluster core loses energy via X-ray radiation because of the collisions between the gas particles. The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density, and the cooling time, which remains in the outer parts too large, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1164;Optical bursts;nan
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629;Gamma-ray bursts;An intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1163;Opposition;The position of a solar system body having its orbit outside that of the Earth when the Earth is in a line between the Sun and the body. At opposition the body has a solar elongation of 180Â°, and is closest to the Earth. It will, in principle, be visible throughout the night. It will rise in the east as the Sun sets in the west and it will set as the Sun rises. This is because, at opposition, the body and the Sun are 12 hours apart. The inner planets can never be in opposition. The opposite of opposition is conjunction.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/626;Galaxy winds;An outflow of hot gas, analogous to the solar wind, from a galaxy that has recently undergone a high burst of star formation or has an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy winds are streams of high speed charged particles blowing out of galaxies with speeds of 300 to 3,000 km s^-1. In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. A prominent example is the superwind of the starburst galaxy M82.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2045;Schonberg-Chandrasekhar limit;During the main sequence stage, a star burns the hydrogen in its core and transforms it into helium. When the helium mass amounts to about 10% of the initial stellar mass, the star can no longer maintain the hydrostatic equilibrium in its core; the star increases its volume and leaves the main sequence in order to become a red giant.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2046;Stellar evolutionary models;nan
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2047;Main sequence;An evolutionary stage in the life of a star when it generates its energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via nuclear fusion in its core. Stars spend 90% of their life on the main sequence. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram it appears as a track running from top left (high temperature, high luminosity, high mass) to lower right (low temperature, low luminosity, low mass).
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2048;Horizontal branch;A set of roughly horizontal points in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of a typical globular cluster. It displays a stage of stellar evolution which immediately follows the red giant branch (RGB) in stars with an initial mass < 1.2 M_sun. When the star's ascent of the RGB is terminated by the helium flash, it moves down to the Horizontal Branch (HB). The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources: in addition to the helium burning in their cores, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell, involving low opacity, makes the star look blue. The HB domain encompasses a very large effective temperature range with several members: extreme HB, blue HB, RR Lyrae, red HB, and red clump stars. The locations depend on many parameters, including stellar mass, metallicity, age, helium abundance, and rotation.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/656;Globular star clusters;A spherical aggregate of stars made up of thousands to a few million stars which is an orbiting satellite of a galaxy. There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641;General relativity;The theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein (1916) that describes the gravitation as the space-time curvature caused by the presence of matter or energy. Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/185;Brown dwarfs;A star-like object whose mass is too small to sustain hydrogen fusion in its interior and become a star. Brown dwarfs are substellar objects and occupy an intermediate regime between those of stars and giant planets. With a mass less than 0.08 times that of the Sun (about 80 Jupiter masses), nuclear reactions in the core of brown dwarfs are limited to the transformation of deuterium into Helium-3. The reason is that the cores of these objects are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure (at early spectral types) and Coulomb pressure (at later spectral types). Brown dwarfs, as ever cooling objects, will have late M dwarf spectral types within a few Myrs of their formation and gradually evolve as L, T and Y dwarfs brown dwarf cooling. As late-M and early-L dwarfs, they overlap in temperature with the cool end of the stellar main sequence (M dwarf, L dwarf, T dwarf, Y dwarf). In contrast to the OBAFGKM sequence, the M-L-T-Y sequence is an evolutionary one.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1618;Stellar parallax;The apparent difference in the position of a celestial object as seen by an observer from two widely separated locations. The parallax of an object can be used to derive its distance. The relationship between the parallax angle  p (measured in seconds of arc) and the distance d (measured in astronomical units) is given by d = 206,264 / p. For a parallax angle p = 1'', the distance to the star would correspond to 206,264 AU. By convention, the distance unit parsec is defined to be equivalent to 206,264 AU. Therefore, the parallax relation takes the much simpler form: d (in pc) = 1/p (in seconds of arc). The first star whose parallax was measured was 61 Cygni (Bessel, 1838).

In stars of mass greater than about 8 solar masses, whose cores reach a temperature above 5 x 10^8 K and density above 3 x 10^9 kg m^-3, carbon burning can begin via reactions such as the following:  12C + 12C â 20Ne + 4He or 12C + 12C â 23Na + p or 12C + 12C â 23Mg + n.  The time-scale for this phase of nucleosynthesis is of order of five hundred years.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/196;Carbon dioxide;CO_2, also called carbonic acid gas. A colorless gas which occurs in the atmosphere playing an essential part in animal respiration and the growth of green plants.  It is formed by the oxidation of carbon and carbon compounds. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas produced by human activities, primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels. Its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere has risen by more than 30% since the Industrial Revolution. CO_2 forms a solid at -78.5 Â°C at atmospheric pressure, and is used as a refrigerant in this form as a dry ice for the preservation of frozen foods. As carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air and does not support combustion, it is used in fire extinguishers.  CO_2 is present in the interstellar medium and is one of the main molecules in comets.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1602;Stellar feedback;The process whereby large quantities of energy and momentum are released into the gas surrounding star formation regions in galaxies. More specifically, massive stars inject energy, mass, and metals back to the interstellar medium through stellar winds and supernova explosions. Feedback inhibits further star formation either by removing gas from the galaxy, or by heating it to temperatures that are too high to form new stars. Observations reveal feedback in the form of galactic-scale outflows of gas in galaxies with high star formation rates, especially in the early Universe. Feedback in faint, low-mass galaxies probably facilitated the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies when the Universe was about 500 million years old, so that the hydrogen between galaxies changed from neutral to ionized, a process called reionization.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/170;Bode's law;The empirical rule relating the approximate distances of the solar system planets from the Sun.

The planets were seen to fit this sequence quite well, provided the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter are counted as one planet, as did Uranus discovered in 1781. However, Neptune and the ex-planet Pluto do not conform to the rule. The question of whether there is any physical significance to the 'law,' i.e. some dynamical reason that will explain planetary orbit spacing has led to much discussion during the past two centuries. Today, many astronomers are very skeptical and consider this 'law' to be numerical coincidence.

It is defined by the relationship R = k(10g + f), where R is the sunspot number, k is a constant depending on the observation conditions and the instrument used, g is the number of the groups and f is the number of individual spots that can be counted.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1653;Sunspots;An area seen as a dark patch on the Sun's surface. Sunspots appear dark because they are cooler (of about 4000 Â°C) than the surrounding photosphere (about 6000 Â°C). They range in size from a few hundred kilometers to several times the Earth's diameter and last from a few hours to a few months. Very small sunspots are called pores. The number of sunspots varies from maximum to minimum in about 11 years, the sunspot cycle. Their appearance during a cycle follows the Sporer law. A typical spot has a central umbra surrounded by a penumbra, although either features can exist without the other. Sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields of 0.2 to 0.4 tesla. A given sunspot has a single magnetic polarity. The opposite polarity may be found in other sunspots or in the bright and diffuse facular region adjacent to the sunspot. The first recorded naked-eye sightings of sunspots were by Chinese astronomers in the first century B.C. Johannes Fabricius (1587-1617) was the first to argue that sunspots are areas on the solar surface.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1679;T dwarfs;A type of brown dwarf with an effective temperature between about 1200 K and 500 K, i.e. colder than the preceding type L dwarf. The spectra of T dwarfs are characterized by the presence of methane bands in the near infrared. The presence of these bands, broad H_{2}O features, and H_2 collision-induced absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of T dwarfs compared to a black body at the same temperature. Hence near-infrared colors become increasingly blue (J - K ~ 0) as compared to L dwarfs. The first T dwarf, called Gl 229B, was discovered by Nakajima et al. The spectral classification scheme (subtypes T0 to T9) currently used was defined by Burgasser et al.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1667;Supernova remnants;The body of expanding gas ejected at a speed of about 10,000 km s^-1 by a supernova explosion, observed as a diffuse gaseous nebula, often with a shell-like structure. Supernova remnants are generally powerful radio sources. The evolution of the SNR can be divided into different phases according to the dominant physical processes. Simplified models are made for the first stages, to get an idea of typical time scales, expansion velocities, and sizes. The three main phases are: 1) the free expansion phase, 2) the Sedov-Taylor phase, and 3) the snowplow phase.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1668;Supernovae;A violent stellar explosion which blows off all or most of the star's material at high velocity leaving a compact stellar remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1669;Surface gravity;The rate at which a small object in free fall near the surface of a body is accelerated by the gravitational force of the body: g = GM / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant, and M and R are the mass and radius of the object.

Escape velocity 2.38 km s-1. Surface gravity 162.2 cm s-2 = 0.165 Earth's. Sidereal period 27d 7h 43m 11s. Eccentricity 0.0549. Inclination of orbital plane to ecliptic 5Â° 8' 43''. Obliquity 6Â° 41'. Synodic period 29d 12h 44m 2s.9. Orbital velocity 1.02 km s-1. The Moon's average visual albedo is 0.12, a factor of three smaller than that of Earth. The Moon's center of mass is displaced about 2 km in the direction of Earth. The average temperature on the surface of the Moon during the day is 107 Â°C. During the night, the average temperature drops to -153 Â°C. Studies of lunar rock have shown that melting and separation must have begun at least 4.5 x 109 years ago, so the crust of the Moon was beginning to form a very short time after the solar system itself. Thickness of crust ~ 60 km; of mantle ~ 1000 km. Temperature of core ~ 1500 K. It would have taken only 107 years to slow the Moon's rotation into its present lock with its orbital period. Because of this synchronous rotation, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth, thus always presenting the same face, the nearside, toward Earth. The Moon may have formed during a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized rocky planet about 4.6 billion years ago; Theia.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/578;Galaxy bulges;A spheroidal region at the center of a spiral galaxy which mostly contains old stars. Galactic bulges are generally classified into two types: classical bulges and pseudo-bulges.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1698;Tidal friction;The friction exerted on a primary body (Earth) because of the phase lag between the tides and the gravitational attraction of the secondary body (Moon). The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1681;T Tauri stars;A member of a class of young stellar objects of roughly 1 solar mass showing strong infrared excess emission attributed to circumstellar disks and found within or close to molecular clouds. T Tauri stars are protostars in the final stages of formation to become a stable main sequence star. The nuclear reactions in their core have not yet stabilized and the stars are known for the variability of their brightness.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/108;Asymptotic giant branch;A region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram populated by evolving low-mass to intermediate-mass stars. These stars have an electron degenerate core of carbon and oxygen surrounded by two burning shells of helium and hydrogen. The H and He-burning shells are activated alternately in the deep layers of the star. An extended and tenuous convection envelope, having a radius of 10^4 - 10^5 times the size of the core, lies above these shells. The loosely bound envelope is gradually eroded by the strong stellar wind, which forms a dusty circumstellar envelope out to several hundreds of stellar radii. The convective envelope, stellar atmosphere, and circumstellar envelope have a rich and changing chemical composition provided by nucleosynthesis processes in the burning shells in the deep interior.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1236;Photon sphere;A surface where if a photon is emitted from one of its points the photon follows a closed orbit and returns periodically to its departure point. Such a surface exists only near sufficiently compact objects where the curvature of space-time is very important. In other words, a body can take a stable orbit around a black hole provided that it moves with the speed of light. However, only photons can have such a velocity; hence the term 'photon sphere.' For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the photon sphere has a radius of R = 3GM/c2 = 3 RS/2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, c is the speed of light, and RS is the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating, Kerr black hole, the situation is much more complex due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In that case circular paths exist for radii whose values depend on the rotation direction. More specifically, in the equatorial plane there are two possible circular light paths: a smaller one in the direction of the rotation, and a larger one in the opposite direction.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/558;G stars;A member of a class of stars to which the Sun belongs. The G-type stars on the main sequence have surface temperatures of 5,300-6,000 K and therefore appear yellow in color. G type giant stars (such as Capella) are almost 100-500 K colder than the corresponding main sequence stars. G type supergiants have temperatures of 4,500-5,500 K. The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses. The luminosities of G-type giants are almost 30-60 times greater than that of the Sun, whereas the supergiants are 10,000-30,000 times more luminous.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/138;Baryon acoustic oscillations;In cosmology, one of a series of peaks and troughs that are present in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations after the recombination era, and on large scales. At the time of the Big Bang, and for about 380,000 years afterwards, Universe was ionized and photons and baryons were tightly coupled. Acoustic oscillations arose from perturbations in the primordial plasma due to the competition between gravitational attraction and gas+photons pressure. After the epoch of recombination, these oscillations froze and imprinted their signatures in both the CMB and matter distribution. In the case of the photons, the acoustic mode history is manifested as the high-contrast Doppler peaks in the temperature anisotropies. As for baryons, they were in a similar state, and when mixed with the non-oscillating cold dark matter perturbations, they left a small residual imprint in the clustering of matter on very large scales, ~100 h^-1 Mpc (h being the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The phenomenon of BAOs, recently discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, is a confirmation of the current model of cosmology. Like Type Ia supernovae, BAOs provide a standard candle for determining cosmic distances. The measurement of BAOs is therefore a powerful new technique for probing how dark energy has affected the expansion of the Universe.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2105;CEMP stars;A star that presents very low iron abundances [Fe/H] < -4 but an anomalous richness in carbon. CEMP stars have been defined as a subset of metal-poor stars that exhibit elevated [C/Fe] â¥ +1.0. It has been recognized that ~15-20% of stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0 are carbon enhanced. This fraction rises to 30% for [Fe/H] < -3.0, to 40% for [Fe/H] < -3.5, and ~75% for [Fe/H] < -4.0. This increasing trend of CEMP-star frequency with declining [Fe/H] is confirmed by the observation of many thousands of CEMP stars.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2129;Spectral energy distribution;A plot showing the energy emitted by a source as a function of the radiation wavelength or frequency. It is used in many branches of astronomy to characterize astronomical sources, in particular mainly in near infrared and middle infrared to study protostars or young stellar objects. The SED of these objects is divided in four classes. Class 0 in which the SED represents a very embedded protostar, where the mass of the central core is small in comparison to the mass of the accreting envelope. The SED is characterized by the blackbody radiation of the envelope and peaks at submillimeter wavelengths. Class I objects possess a SED that peaks in the far infrared and is characterized by a weak contribution of the blackbody of the central protostar (detected in near infrared) and the emission of a thick disk and dense envelope. These objects have less mass in the envelope and more massive central cores with respect to Class 0. Class II objects are the classical T Tauri stars with a SED due to the emission of a thin disk and the central star. They have accumulated most of their final mass and have dispersed almost completely their circumstellar envelope. Finally, Class III objects have pure photospheric spectra. Their SED is peaked in the optical and is well approximated by a blackbody emission with a faint infrared excess due to the presence of a residual optically thin disk that may be the origin of planetesimals. This classification scheme can be made more quantitative by defining a spectral index.

Pluto revolves around the Sun in a highly elliptical orbit at a mean distance of 39.5 astronomical units once every about 248 years. The orbit eccentricity is 0.25 (compare with the Earth's 0.02) yielding a perihelion distance of 29.66 astronomical units and an aphelion distance of 48.87 AU. Its orbital inclination is 17 degrees, which is much higher than those of the other planets. Pluto's mass is 1.308 x 10^22 kg, that is 0.00218 Earth mass (0.177 Moon mass), its equatorial radius is 0.19 Earth radius, and its rotation period is equal to 6.39 Earth days. It has five known satellites, in order of distance from Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto's radius is estimated to be about 1150 km (0.18 Earths). Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's satellites (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, and Triton). Pluto's surface has an estimated temperature of 37.5 K and is composed of more than 98% nitrogen  ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/128;B stars;A star of spectral type B, whose spectrum is marked by absorption lines of hydrogen; also known as B-type star. B-type optical spectra are characterized by the presence of neutral He lines (mainly He I 4471 Ã) at about type B9. He I strengthens up to about B2, then decreases. Ionized helium (mainly He II 4541 Ã) first appears at about B0. Most metallic lines are absent or weak, except some absorption lines for the higher ionization states of silicon, oxygen, carbon, and magnesium. These are hot stars with effective temperatures ranging from about 10,000 K at B9 to nearly 30,000 K at B0. They are between 3 and 20 solar masses. Some famous examples include  Rigel, Achernar, and Hadar.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2110;Blazhko effect;A long term, generally irregular modulation of light curves of a large subclass of RR Lyrae stars. Most of the modulations occur on the time scale of some 60 periods, although the range extends from some tens to some hundreds of periods. Since its discovery over a hundred years ago, a number of explanations have been proposed for this effect, but its nature is still a matter of investigation. The explanations include: closely spaced pulsation modes, a modal 1:2 resonance, an oblique rotator model, a non-radial modal interaction, convective cycles, and nonlinear resonant mode coupling between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/124;Azimuth;The angular distance from the North point eastward to the intersection of the horizon with the vertical circle passing through the object. Azimuth is 0Â° for an object due north, 90Â° due east, 180Â° due south, and 270Â° due west.  Altitude and azimuth constitute the horizon coordinate system.
