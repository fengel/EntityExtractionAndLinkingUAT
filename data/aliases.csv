http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1054;The Galaxy;A spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.

They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II).

The physical cause of the FR-I/II dichotomy probably lies in the type of flow in the radio jets.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/940;Ultradiffuse galaxies;A member of a particularly faint population of galaxies with a central surface brightness below the brightness of the background sky. The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars. Spiral LSBGs do not obey Freeman's law.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/941;Luminosity class;A classification of stellar spectra according to luminosity for a given spectral type. The luminosity class is an indication of a star's surface gravity. It is shown by a Roman numeral as follows: I (supergiants), II (bright giants), III (normal giants), IV (subgiants), and V (dwarf stars, or main-sequence stars). Luminosity classes VI (subdwarfs) and VII (white dwarfs) are rarely used. Subclasses a, b, and c are especially used for supergiants, while the most luminous hypergiants are assigned luminosity class Ia-0.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/917;Physical libration;Small oscillations of a celestial body about its mean position. The term is used mainly to mean the Moon's libration caused by the apparent wobble of the Moon as it orbits the Earth. The Moon always keeps the same side toward the Earth, but due to libration, 59% of the Moon's surface can be seen over a period of time. This results from three kinds of libration working in combination: libration in longitude, libration in latitude, and diurnal libration.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920;Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory;A facility dedicated to the detection and measurement of cosmic gravitational waves. It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1991;Solar F coronal region;The exterior part of the solar corona, illuminated by solar light scattered or reflected by dust particles. The same phenomenon also produces the zodiacal light, much farther away from the Sun. The dust particles are at most several microns in size and make up a disk stretching over almost 1 solar radius (700,000 km) from the Sun's surface. Unlike electrons, which are responsible for the K corona, the dust particles move relatively slowly. Thus, the light scattered by them has the same spectrum as the photosphere and shows the Fraunhofer lines. The F corona is the most luminous part of the corona at 1.5 solar radii from the Sun's surface.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1551;Special theory of relativity;The theory formulated by A. Einstein in 1905, which is based on the following two postulates: 1) Principle of relativity: The laws of physical phenomena are the same when studied in terms of two reference systems moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. 2) Principle of constancy: The velocity of light in free space is the same for all observers and is independent of the relative velocity of the source of light and the observer.  The term 'special theory of relativity' refers to the restriction in the first postulate to reference systems moving at a constant velocity relative to each other (inertial reference frame).

Due to spatial resolution constraints, starspots so far observed are in general much larger than those on the Sun, up to about 30% of the stellar surface may be covered, corresponding to sizes 100 times greater than those on the Sun.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1570;Starburst galaxy;A galaxy showing a short-lived intense period of star formation that is unsustainable over the Hubble time due to the limited supply of gas within a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were first classified by Searle & Sargent (1972) and Searle et al. (1973), based on the blue colors produced by the massive stars formed during the burst. In the local Universe, starbursts create approximately 10% of the radiant energy and 20% of the massive stars. At z = 1, starburst characteristics are found in 15% of galaxies, presumably attributable to the greater amounts of gas typically present in young galaxies and increased galactic interactions. The starburst's impact on a galaxy and the surrounding intergalactic medium is primarily due to the consumption of gas that fuels the burst and the feedback from massive stars formed in the burst.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/456;E galaxies;A galaxy whose structure is smooth without spiral arms and ellipsoidal in shape. Ellipticals are redder than spirals of similar mass. Giant ellipticals contain over 1012 solar masses, whereas dwarf ellipticals have masses as low as 107 solar masses.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/467;Equatorial system;An astronomical coordinate system for indicating the positions of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. The system consists of two components, right ascension and declination. Right ascension is the angle between the vernal equinox and the point where the hour circle intersects the celestial equator. The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°. Equatorial coordinates change with time due to the precession of the Earth's rotation axis.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/439;Planet Earth;The third planet from the Sun. At perihelion, it is 147,099,590 km from the Sun, and at aphelion it is 152,096.150 km, whereas its mean distance from the Sun (astronomical unit) is 149,598 x 10^6 km. Its orbital period is 365.2563 days (sidereal year) and its eccentricity 0.017. Other characteristics: axial inclination 23.44°; rotation period 23.934 h (sidereal day); mean density 5.52 g/cm^3; mass 5.974 x 10^24 kg; escape velocity 11.18 km/s; average albedo 0.37.  The Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.9% argon, plus carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and other gases in much smaller quantities. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 1,000 mbar. The surface average temperature is 15° C, but it varies, on the average, between -50° C (winter, Siberia) and up to + 40° C (summer, Sahara).  Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1155;Of-type stars;An O star whose spectrum displays strong N III 4634-4640-4642 emission and strong He II 4686 emission. The N III lines are always much stronger than C III 4647-4650-4651 when the latter are present. Historically, Of stars were considered to belong to the peculiar category, hence the f notation (see below). In his thesis work, Walborn removed them from that category and established them as the normal O-type supergiants. He also used the notation ((f)), (f), and f to describe the progression from strong He II 4686 absorption, through weakened/absent, to emission, respectively, correlated with increasing N III emission strength, subsequently showing that it is a luminosity sequence -- the first such for stars earlier than O9.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858;ICM;A diffuse, hot, magnetized plasma that exists between galaxies in a galaxy cluster and is composed mainly of H, He, and heavy elements. The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/420;Dwarf spheroidals;A subtype of dwarf ellipticals (dwarf elliptical galaxy), which are companion to the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. The first example of such objects was discovered by Harlow Shapley (1938) in the constellation Sculptor. 22 such galaxies are known currently to orbit the Milky Way and at least 36 exist in the Local Group of galaxies. Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible. Many of the Local Group dSph galaxies show evidence for star formation more recent than 10 Gyr.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/418;U Geminorum-type variable stars;A class of novae and cataclysmic variables that have multiple observed eruptions. Their prototype is U Geminorum star. Optically, dwarf nova eruptions have amplitudes of 2-6 mag in V, a duration of a few to 20 days and a recurrence time-scale of weeks to years. Dwarf novae are thought to be semidetached binary stars consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting via Roche lobe overflow from a companion which is usually a late-type, generally main-sequence star. DN outbursts are usually attributed to the release of gravitational energy resulting from an instability in the accretion disk or by sudden mass transfers through the disk.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/419;Dwarf planets (Solar system);A new category of astronomical objects in the solar system introduced in a resolution by the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24, 2006. The characterizing properties are as follows: 1) It is in orbit around the Sun; 2) It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape; 3) It has not 'cleared the neighbourhood' around its orbit; and 4) It is not a satellite of a planet, or other non-stellar body. The property 3 reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet because it has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit (the Kuiper Belt). The largest known dwarf planets are: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, and 2015 RR245.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/429;Early type galaxies;In the Hubble classification, galaxies on the left part of the Hubble sequence. Early-type galaxies tend to have redder colors, higher average surface brightnesses, and lower neutral hydrogen content than late-type galaxies.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/422;Gravitational drag;The gravitational interaction between a relatively massive body and a field of much less massive bodies through which the massive body travels. As a result, the moving body loses momentum and kinetic energy. An example of dynamical friction is the sinking of massive stars to the center of a star cluster, a process called mass segregation. Dynamical friction plays an important role in stellar dynamics. It was first quantified by Chandrasekhar (1943).
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882;κ-mechanism;A process based on the effects of opacity (κ) that drives the pulsations of many types of variable stars. Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.

If the source is moving away, the wavelength is stretched (shifted toward lower frequencies). If the source is approaching, the wavelength is compressed (shifted toward higher frequencies). These effects, known as Doppler shifts, are in the case of light waves called redshift and blueshift, respectively.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1806;Wolf Rayet stars;A type of very luminous, very hot (as high as 50,000 K) stars whose spectrum is characterized by broad emission lines (mainly He I and He II), which are presumed to originate from material ejected from the star at very high (~ 2000 km s^-1) velocities. The most massive O stars (M > 25 solar masses for solar metallicity) become W-R stars around 2 and 3 million years after their birth, spending only some few hundreds of thousands of years (≤ 10^6 years) in this phase until they explode as type Ib and type Ic supernovae. The minimum stellar mass that an O star needs to reach the W-R phase and its duration is dependent on metallicity.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1810;X-ray galaxies;The study of celestial bodies using their X-ray emission. X-ray astronomy deals mainly with Galactic and extragalactic phenomena involving very high-energy photon emissions, covering a band of energies between 0.1 keV and 500 keV. The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere. The first rocket flight which successfully detected a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by an American research group.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1811;X-ray binaries;A binary star system where one of the stars has evolved and collapsed into an extremely dense body such as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. The enormous gravitational attraction of the massive, dense, but dim component pulls material from the brighter, less massive star in an accretion disk. The gravitational potential energy of the accreted matter is converted to heat by viscosity and eventually to high-energy photons in the X-ray range. The brightest X-ray binary is Scorpius X-1.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1828;Rho Cassiopeiae;An evolved, very massive star of spectral type F or G with a very high luminosity (~10^5 times solar) lying near the empirical upper luminosity boundary in the H-R diagram (Humphreys-Davidson limit). Yellow hypergiants have high mass loss rates (10^-5 - 10^-3 solar masses per year) and are in a short, transitional evolutionary stage. Their evolutionary state is thought to correspond to post-red supergiants rapidly evolving in blueward loops in the H-R diagram. In their post-RSG blueward evolution these stars enter a temperature range (6000-9000 K), called yellow void, with increased dynamical instability. Their link to other advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars such as Luminous Blue Variables and Wolf-Rayet stars is still an open issue in stellar evolution theory. The most famous yellow hypergiant is Rho Cassiopeiae.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1852;X-ray transient;An X-ray source that enhances its emission well above its usual level for a period typically longer than a week. Recurrences can be periodic or aperiodic, but there is no obvious correlation between recurrence time and the luminosity amplitude of the outburst. X-ray transients seem to be divided into two classes: those associated with high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) stars and those associated with low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) stars. The HMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole paired with a massive star. Often, the stellar companion is a Be star, Be star, which sometimes sheds material from its equatorial region. In these systems, the transient event is characterized by having more higher energy X-rays in the spectrum. The LMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole orbiting around a cooler, low-mass star. These transient events often generate more lower-energy X-rays.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/93;Mural sextants;An instrument used mainly in nautical astronomy to determine the angular distances of celestial bodies above the horizon. The sextant consists of a 60° graduated arc, or limb, a small telescope, and two mirrors. Only half of one of the mirrors, the horizon glass, is silvered and, like the telescope, it is fastened to the frame supporting the limb. The other mirror, the index mirror, moves with an index arm pivoted at the center of the arc. The index arm is equipped with a vernier which moves along the limb. An object in direction S can be observed in the telescope through the un-silvered portion of the horizon glass. By moving the index arm, the second object S' is made to coincide with S in the telescope. According to the law of reflection, the angle between S and S' is double the angle between the mirrors. The angular distance between the objects can therefore be obtained from the measurement of angles between the planes of the mirrors.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1404;Roche radius;The smallest distance at which a satellite under the influence of its own gravitation and that of a central mass about which it is describing a Keplerian orbit can be in equilibrium. This does not, however, apply to a body held together by the stronger forces between atoms and molecules. At a lesser distance the tidal forces of the primary body would break up the secondary body. The Roche limit is given by the formula d = 1.26 R_M (ρ_M/ρ_m)^(1/3), where R_M is the radius of the primary body, ρ_M is the density of the primary, and ρ_m is the density of the secondary body. This formula can also be expressed as: d = 1.26 R_m (M_M/M_m)^(1/3), where R_m is the radius of the secondary. As an example, for the Earth-Moon system, where R_M = 6,378 km, ρ_M = 5.5 g cm^(-3), and ρ_m = 2.5 g cm^(-3) is 1.68 Earth radii.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1444;Semiregular variable stars;A type of giant or supergiant pulsating variable star, with intermediate or late spectra, showing noticeable periodicity in its light changes, accompanied or sometimes interrupted by various irregularities. Periods lie in the range from 20 to more than 2000 days, while the shapes of the light curve may be rather different and variable with each cycle. The amplitudes may be from several hundredths to several magnitudes (usually 1-2 magnitudes in the V filter). Examples are Betelgeuse, Antares, and Rasalgethi. Semiregular variables are classified in several subtypes: SRA, SRB, SRC, and SRD.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/52;Aperiodic comets;A body other than a star or substellar object not gravitationally bound to a star. Its hyperbolic orbit would indicate an object not bound to the Sun. The first known ISO is 1I/'Oumuamua. ISOs are icy planetesimals that are expected to behave like the long-period comets of the solar system; volatile ices sublimate when the ISO approaches the Sun, developing a coma and a dust tail -- features that should make them bright and therefore easy to spot. The rocky ISOs, on the other hand, only reflect sunlight. As their albedo is expected to be extremely low they become dark (after eons of bombardment by high-energy cosmic rays), they would be extremely faint and hard to detect.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/73;Stellar seismology;The study of the internal structure of stars through the interpretation of their pulsation periods (stellar pulsation). The radial pulsations are the result of sound waves resonating in the stars interior. Different pulsation modes penetrate to different depths inside a star. If a large number of pulsation modes occurs, then the stellar interior, which is not directly observable, can be probed from oscillation studies because the modes penetrate to various depths inside the star. Using a complex mathematical analysis, very detailed investigations of the structure of the star's interior can be carried out. Applied to the Sun, it is called helioseismology.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/329;Primary cosmic ray;Extremely energetic atomic nuclei which travel through the Universe at practically the speed of light and strike the Earth from all direction. Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays. Their energy ranges from 10^9 to 10^20 electron-volts.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/380;Translucent interstellar clouds;An interstellar cloud in which hydrogen is completely dissociated and which is less dense and dusty than molecular clouds. In diffuse interstellar clouds photoabsorption of the background ultraviolet (UV) radiation field is an important dissociating and ionizing process. Typical densities and temperatures of diffuse clouds are 10^2 to 10^3 cm^-3 and 20 to 100 K respectively.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1015;Prolonged sunspot minimum;A period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low. This solar activity minimum is attested also through the increased content of carbon-14 in tree rings in that period. The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age. The Maunder minimum is one of a number of periods of low solar activity, including the Dalton minimum, the Sporer minimum, the Wolf minimum, and the Oort minimum.

The nucleus emits high energy radiation (gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet) and shows variability over various time-scales, sometimes very short (hours to weeks). Emission line spectra reveal high velocity motions up to 10^4 km s^-1. AGNs are divided into two main types. Type I refers to an AGN whose nucleus is visible (the spectra has both narrow and broad emission lines), while in type II AGN, the broad line region (BLR) is obscured and the lines are very narrow. This may be due either to the viewing angle or some intrinsic difference in structure.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/14;Particle accretion;The process by which an object increases its mass under the influence of its gravitational attraction. Accretion plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In particular stars result from the accretion of material by a protostar from a surrounding molecular cloud. The accumulation of mass on the protostar involves the formation of an accretion disk. Theoretical and observational investigations of protostars and newborn stars indicate the important role of magnetic fields in this process. They favor the magnetospheric accretion model for mass transfer from the circumstellar disk onto the newborn star. In this model, the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk at a few stellar radii. Gas from the disk accretes onto the star along the magnetic field lines and hits the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity, causing a strong accretion shock. Various emission lines are formed in the infalling magnetospheric flow. Moreover, optical/ultraviolet excess continuum emission is produced in the accretion shocks.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1031;Metal abundances;In a star, nebula, or galaxy, the proportion of the material that is made up of metals, that is elements heavier than helium. It is generally denoted by Z. The term 'metallicity' is a misnomer used in astrophysics.  In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction.  Nebular metallicity is often defined as the relative abundance of oxygen: (NO/NH)neb/(NO/NH)Sun, where N_O and N_H represent the numbers of oxygen and hydrogen atoms per unit volume.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/42;Heliocentric parallax;The difference in position of a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i.e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean  radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Same as heliocentric parallax.  Because the Earth revolves around the Sun, we observe the sky from a constantly moving position in space. Therefore, we should expect to see an annual effect, in which the positions of nearby objects appear to oscillate back and forth in response to our motion around the Sun. This does in fact happen, but the distances to even the nearest stars are so great that we need to make careful observations with a telescope to detect it. The annual parallax of the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 0.762 arcsec, which is too small for our acuity of vision.

On the H-R diagram, δ Scuti stars form a group which lies in an instability strip which includes the classical Cepheids at its brightest end and the pulsating white dwarfs at its faintest limit. These stars can show very complex light variations since, while some of them are pulsating in one radial mode only, others may be pulsating simultaneously in several radial and non-radial modes.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1025;Mercury manganese stars;Chemically peculiar stars of late B-types. The most distinctive features of Mercury-manganese stars are extreme atmospheric overabundance of Hg (up to 5 dex) and of Mn (up to 3 dex). The origin of abundance anomalies observed in late B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity is still poorly understood. More than two thirds of the HgMn stars are known to belong to spectroscopic binaries with a preference of orbital periods ranging from 3 to 20 days.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024;Mercury;The closest planet to the Sun and one of five planets visible with the naked eye. The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/31;AM CVn stars;A binary system that has very short orbital period (less than one hour) and helium dominated spectrum. The prototype, AM Canum Venaticorum, with a period of 17 minutes, was discovered in 1967. AM CVn stars are semidetached binary systems in which accretion is going on. The donor star is hydrogen deficient and the accretor is usually a white dwarf. To fit within their Roche lobes, the donor stars must be dense, suggesting they may be degenerate too. It is at present thought that AM CVn stars represent three possible evolutionary phases in 1) double white dwarf systems, 2) white dwarf and helium star binaries, and 3) cataclysmic variables with evolved donors.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/33;Am-type stars;A chemically peculiar A- or early F-type star showing an overabundance of heavy elements and an underabundance of calcium and scandium. An Am star cannot receive a unique spectral type, as different methods (using the metallic lines, the hydrogen Balmer lines, and the calcium Ca II K-lines) yield three different spectral types. Contrarily to Ap stars, Am stars do not have significant external magnetic fields. Their rotational velocities are about 100-120 km s-1 smaller than those of Ap stars.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732;High mass stars;A star whose mass is larger than approximately 10 solar masses. The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1285;First stars;A member of the first generation of stars, formed out of pristine gas, enriched by primordial nucleosynthesis alone. The material from which these stars formed consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. Because neutral hydrogen clouds were free of dust, their cooling mechanism was drastically ineffective. As a result, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore, these first generation of stars were principally massive, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation, namely Population II. Some models predict a bimodal initial mass function for the first stars, allowing also for solar mass stars.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/725;Color-color diagrams of stars;A display of stellar properties using a plot of effective temperature (or instead color or spectral type) along the abscissa versus luminosity (or absolute magnitude). The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.

Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2181;Halley's comet;The most famous comet orbiting the Sun once about every 75 years. The last time it appeared was in 1986, and it is predicted to return in 2061. Its earliest recorded sighting is traced back to 240 BC in China. In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758. Halley's comet is the first known periodic comet, hence its designation 1P/Halley.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2188;Jupiter III;The seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites. This Galilean satellite has a diameter of 5270 km, slightly larger than Mercury, a mass about 1.48 × 10^23 kg (about 2 Earth Moons); an orbital period of 7.155 days, and an eccentricity of e = 0.0015. It was discovered by Galileo and Marius in 1610. The mean surface temperature of Ganymede is -160 °C. It is the only moon known to have a magnetosphere.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2189;Jupiter II;The sixth of Jupiter's known moons and the fourth largest; it is the second of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 × 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/775;Hypernova;A highly energetic supernova explosion. This phenomenon, which is more violent than a typical supernova event, is accompanied by a gamma-ray burst.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310;CME;A huge eruption of material from regions of the solar corona in which the magnetic field is closed, but which suffer an extremely energetic disruption. Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/761;HST;A telescope of 2.4 m in diameter, a joint NASA and ESA project, launched in 1990 into a low-Earth orbit 600 km above the ground. It was equipped with a collection of several science instruments that worked across the entire optical spectrum (from infrared, through the visible, to ultraviolet light). During its lifetime Hubble has become one of the most important science projects ever.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/757;Hubble's classification;The classification of galaxies according to their visual appearance into four basic types suggested by E. Hubble: ellipticals (E), spirals (S), barred spirals (SB), and irregulars (Ir). Later on a separate class of lenticulars (S0) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies (E0). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio (a - b)/a, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories (E0, E1, ..., E7). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular (S0) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure: ordinary spirals, S, and barred spirals, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa, Sb, Sc, and SBa, SBb, SBc, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc, the central bulge becomes smaller, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/758;Hubble-Lemaitre constant;The Hubble parameter for the present epoch. It is the constant of proportionality between the recession velocities of galaxies and their distances from each other. The latest determinations using the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheids give H_0 = 72 ± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the WMAP observations yield 70.4 ± 1.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and the Planck Satellite observations give 67.3 ± 1.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. More recently, the Hubble constant was derived by a team of astronomers, using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4% accuracy. The new value, 73.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, suggests that the Universe is expanding between five and nine percent faster than previously calculated. The Hubble law is only applicable for large distances (> 20 Mpc), when the proper motions of galaxies in groups and clusters cannot confuse the recession due to expansion.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2190;Jupiter I;The fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3630 km, Io is slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It revolves at a mean distance of 422,000 km from Jupiter. Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out. Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/703;Black hole evaporation;The radiation produced by a black hole when quantum mechanical effects are taken into account. According to quantum physics, large fluctuations in the vacuum energy occurs for brief moments of time. Thereby virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are created from vacuum and annihilated. If pair production happens just outside the event horizon of a black hole, as soon as these particles are formed they would both experience drastically different gravitational attractions due to the sharp gradient of force close to the black hole. One particle will accelerate toward the black hole and its partner will escape into space. The black hole used some of its gravitational energy to produce these two particles, so it loses some of its mass if a particle escapes. This gradual loss of mass over time means the black hole eventually evaporates out of existence.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1735;ULIRG;A galaxy that emits more than 90% of its energy in the infrared (8-1000 µm) and whose infrared luminosity exceeds 10^12 solar luminosities. Quasars can also have such high or even higher bolometric luminosities. However LIRGs and ULIRGs emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared. Most of ULIRGs are found in merging and interacting galaxy systems. It is thought that their luminosity results from galactic collisions, which increase the rate of star formation.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1736;UV astronomy;The study of astronomical objects in the ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, in the waveband 3000 Å to about 10 Å. At these wavelengths, the atmosphere prevents ultraviolet radiation from reaching the Earth surface. Therefore ground-based observatories cannot observe in the ultraviolet. Only with the advent of space-based telescopes has this area of astronomy become available for research.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1723;Two body problem;In classical mechanics, the study concerned with the dynamics of an isolated system of two particles subject only to the Newtonian gravitational force between them. The problem can be separated into two single-particle problems with the following solutions. The equation of the center of mass is governed by the equation of the same form as that for a single particle. Moreover, the motion of either particle, with respect to the other as origin, is the same as the motion with respect to a fixed origin of a single particle of reduced mass acted on by the same internal force.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1728;Type Ia supernova;A Type I supernova that presents a singly-ionized silicon (Si II) absorption feature at 6150 Å near peak brightness. Type Ia SNe are believed to result from mass accretion to a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion. Type Ia supernovae occur in all types of galaxies. Type Ia SNe are used as standard candles in determining cosmological distances, after normalizing their light curves with the Phillips relation.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1766;VLA;A radio interferometer consisting of 27 antennas, each 25 m in diameter, in a Y-shaped configuration. It is located about 100 km west of Socorro, New Mexico, and is operated by the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The VLA has the resolution of a single antenna 36 km wide and the sensitivity of a dish 130 m across.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1767;VLT;An observing facility consisting of four 8.2 m telescopes, with the combined collecting area of a 16 m mirror, owned and operated by the European Southern Observatory at an altitude of 2635 m at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. The four reflecting unit telescopes are called Antu 'Sun' in the language of Chile's indigenous Mapuche people, Kueyen 'Moon,' Melipal 'Southern Cross,' and Yepun 'Venus.' Each unit is equipped with several sophisticated instruments. The light of the individual telescopes can be combined using interferometric techniques to achieve superior resolution.  The wavelength range covered by the VLT is extremely wide, ranging from deep ultraviolet to mid-infrared.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1769;VLBI;A technique in radio interferometry in which the individual telescopes are not directly connected together, but instead make their observations separately with very accurate timings. The data are later sent to a central correlator to be combined. With this technique the individual telescopes can be arbitrarily far apart, and so the technique provides the highest resolution images in astronomy, typically down to a few milliarcseconds.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1799;Degenerate dwarf;A compact star of high surface temperature, low luminosity, and high density (10^5 - 10^8 g cm^-3), with roughly the mass of the Sun (mean mass ~ 0.6 M_sun) and the radius of the Earth (R ~ 0.01 R_sun), representing the end-point of the evolution of all stars with masses less then ~ 5-9 solar masses. A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1790;H2O masers;An interstellar maser phenomenon in which water (H_{2}O) molecules undergo the processes of population inversion and stimulated emission. H_{2}O masers are detected toward star formation regions and the envelopes of evolved stars. The maser emission comes from regions that are typically quite small, not larger than the solar system. The main emission frequency is 22 GHz, which shows up in strong lines. There are, however, other H_{2}O maser transitions at 380 GHz and 183 GHz, which are much weaker than the 22 GHz line. The former transitions are sporadically detected since they are strongly absorbed in the Earth's atmosphere, because of its high water vapor content.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1300;Protoplanetary disks (Extrasolar);A circumstellar disk of gas and dust surrounding a pre-main sequence star from which planetary systems form. Protoplanetary disks are remnants of accretion disks which bring forth stars. Typically, their sizes are ~100-500 AU, masses ~10^-2 solar masses, lifetimes ~10^6 - 10^7 years, and accretion rates ~10^-7 - 10^-8 solar masses per year. According to the standard theory of planet formation, called core accretion, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1781;von Zeipel's theorem;A theorem that establishes a relation between the radiative flux at some colatitude on the surface of a rotating star and the local effective gravity (which is a function of the angular velocity and colatitude). For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)α, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)β, where β is the gravity darkening exponent. In massive stars this latitudinal dependence of the temperature leads to asymmetric mass loss and also to enhanced average mass loss rates.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1307;Pulsating stars;A type of variable star that changes its brightness by changing its volume through expansion and contraction. Classical pulsating stars, including Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and Delta Scuti variables, are located in a quite narrow almost vertical region in the H-R diagram, known as instability strip.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1784;W Virginis variables;A member of a class of pulsating stars with a period of 1 to 35 days located in the instability strip of the H-R diagram.

They also exhibit a period-luminosity relation which is distinct, but works in a similar way to the relation for Type I Cepheids. Hence W Virginis stars can also be used to measure Galactic and extragalactic distances.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1785;Walraven photometric system;A photometric system with five wavelength ranges that does not use filters. Instead it uses prisms and lenses (spectroscopy) to select the bands simultaneously. The wavelengths and the bandwidths are: W, 3250 and 140 Å; U, 3630 and 240 Å; L, 3840 and 230 Å; B, 4320 and 450 Å; and V, 5470 and 720 Å. The Walraven photometer was unique in design and remained literally unique as copies were never built. In addition, during its whole life the photometer was mounted permanently on the same telescope that had been built specifically for this instrument, the 91 cm 'Lightcollector' reflector, which started in 1958 at the Leiden Southern Station in Broederstroom, South-Africa. After 20 years in South-Africa the telescope and photometer were moved to the European Southern Observatory La Silla observatory in Chile. The photometric observations were resumed in March 1979 and continued for another 12 years until the decommissioning of the photometer in 1991.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/218;Cepheid stars;A class of luminous, yellow supergiants that are pulsating variables and whose period of variation is a function of their luminosity. These stars expand and contract at extremely regular periods, in the range 1-50 days. Their highest brightness and surface temperature occur when their expansion velocity is greatest. Similarly, their minima in brightness and temperature occur when they are in the contraction phase. The longer the period, the more luminous the star. The process that drives the pulsation of Cepheid variables is the kappa mechanism. In fact, Cepheids provide one of the most powerful tools for measuring distances to other galaxies (period-luminosity relation). However, this method is limited to the distance of the Virgo cluster of galaxies (15-20 Mpc) even with the HST or the largest ground-based telescopes. One particularly special Cepheid is the North Star, Polaris.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/219;Asteroid Ceres;Once qualified as the largest known asteroid, Ceres is now classified as a dwarf planet (2006 IAU General Assembly). It is approximately 950 km across, and resides with tens of thousands of asteroids in the main asteroid belt; it is the largest body of the belt. Its mass is 9.4 x 10^20 kg, its rotation period 9.074 hours, its orbital period 4.60 years, and its semi-major axis 2.767 AU. NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which was placed in orbit around Ceres in 2015, has mapped its surface in great detail. Dawn discovered very bright spots, which reflect far more light than their much darker surroundings. The most prominent of these spots lie inside the crater Occator and suggest that Ceres may be a much more active world than most of its asteroid neighbors.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680;Gravity brightening;The darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1375;Red supergiants;A supergiant star with spectral type K or M. Red supergiants are the largest stars in the Universe, but not necessarily the most massive. Betelgeuse and Antares are the best known examples of a red supergiant.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1372;Red giants;A certain star of spectral type K or later that occupies the upper right portion of the H-R diagram. Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel in the core. They may have a luminosity up to 1000 times greater than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. Red giants belong to the luminosity class III or II (bright giants). They are luminous because of their great size, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium, nuclear reactions in the core stop (Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size (from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100,000,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/237;Expanding circumstellar envelope;A very extensive envelope of cold gaseous materials surrounding evolved cool stars, notably red giants, red supergiants (Mira variables), or asymptotic giant branch stars. The typical size of such envelopes is several thousand times that of the stellar radius and their temperature ranges from 1000 to 10 K. Circumstellar envelopes result from mass loss from the central star (10-7 to 10-4 solar masses per year) and expand with moderate velocities (10 to 15 km sec^-1). The low temperature of the envelope is at the origin of the formation of molecules, which in certain conditions provide maser emission (H_{2}O, OH, SiO). Similarly, dust grains form in the envelope produce an infrared excess emission.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629;γ-ray bursts;An intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.

Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/653;GMC;A massive complex of interstellar gas and dust, consisting mostly of molecular hydrogen, that typically stretches over 150 light-years and contains several hundred thousand solar masses. Giant molecular clouds are the principal sites of star formation.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/655;CS stars;A high-luminosity star that has evolved off the main sequence and lies above the main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A member of the giant branch.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/670;Gravitational lens;A concentration of matter, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, that bends light rays from a background object, resulting in production of multiple images. If the two objects and the Earth are perfectly aligned, the light from the distant object appears as a ring from Earth. This is called an Einstein Ring, since its existence was predicted by Einstein in his theory of general relativity.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/640;Counterglow;A faint glow of light in the night sky seen exactly opposite the Sun. The gegenschein is sunlight back-scattered off millimeter-sized dust particles along the ecliptic. In comparison with zodiacal light (forward-scattered sunlight), which is triangular in shape and found near the horizon, the gegenschein is roughly circular.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/638;Dust-to-gas ratio;The mass ratio of gas to dust. It amounts to approximately 100 in the interstellar medium, but may vary in molecular clouds and circumstellar disks due to dust grain evaporation, dust settling, condensation of gas, etc. The gas-to-dust ratio depends on the metallicity. It is larger in galaxies with lower metallicity.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641;General theory of relativity;The theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein (1916) that describes the gravitation as the space-time curvature caused by the presence of matter or energy. Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/185;Brown dwarf stars;A star-like object whose mass is too small to sustain hydrogen fusion in its interior and become a star. Brown dwarfs are substellar objects and occupy an intermediate regime between those of stars and giant planets. With a mass less than 0.08 times that of the Sun (about 80 Jupiter masses), nuclear reactions in the core of brown dwarfs are limited to the transformation of deuterium into Helium-3. The reason is that the cores of these objects are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure (at early spectral types) and Coulomb pressure (at later spectral types). Brown dwarfs, as ever cooling objects, will have late M dwarf spectral types within a few Myrs of their formation and gradually evolve as L, T and Y dwarfs brown dwarf cooling. As late-M and early-L dwarfs, they overlap in temperature with the cool end of the stellar main sequence (M dwarf, L dwarf, T dwarf, Y dwarf). In contrast to the OBAFGKM sequence, the M-L-T-Y sequence is an evolutionary one.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/196;CO_2;CO_2, also called carbonic acid gas. A colorless gas which occurs in the atmosphere playing an essential part in animal respiration and the growth of green plants.  It is formed by the oxidation of carbon and carbon compounds. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas produced by human activities, primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels. Its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere has risen by more than 30% since the Industrial Revolution. CO_2 forms a solid at -78.5 °C at atmospheric pressure, and is used as a refrigerant in this form as a dry ice for the preservation of frozen foods. As carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air and does not support combustion, it is used in fire extinguishers.  CO_2 is present in the interstellar medium and is one of the main molecules in comets.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/174;Bondi-Hoyle accretion;The accretion of mass by a star (assumed as point particle) moving at a steady speed through an infinite, uniform gas cloud. It is directly proportional to the star mass (M) and the medium density (ρ) and inversely proportional to the relative star/gas velocity (v).
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/170;Bodes law;The empirical rule relating the approximate distances of the solar system planets from the Sun. The original formulation was: a = (n + 4) / 10, where a is the mean distance of a planet from the Sun in astronomical units and n = 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192 (doubling for each successive planet). The planets were seen to fit this sequence quite well, provided the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter are counted as one planet, as did Uranus discovered in 1781. However, Neptune and the ex-planet Pluto do not conform to the rule. The question of whether there is any physical significance to the 'law,' i.e. some dynamical reason that will explain planetary orbit spacing has led to much discussion during the past two centuries. Today, many astronomers are very skeptical and consider this 'law' to be numerical coincidence.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1653;Sun spots;An area seen as a dark patch on the Sun's surface. Sunspots appear dark because they are cooler (of about 4000 °C) than the surrounding photosphere (about 6000 °C). They range in size from a few hundred kilometers to several times the Earth's diameter and last from a few hours to a few months. Very small sunspots are called pores. The number of sunspots varies from maximum to minimum in about 11 years, the sunspot cycle. Their appearance during a cycle follows the Sporer law. A typical spot has a central umbra surrounded by a penumbra, although either features can exist without the other. Sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields of 0.2 to 0.4 tesla. A given sunspot has a single magnetic polarity. The opposite polarity may be found in other sunspots or in the bright and diffuse facular region adjacent to the sunspot. The first recorded naked-eye sightings of sunspots were by Chinese astronomers in the first century B.C. Johannes Fabricius (1587-1617) was the first to argue that sunspots are areas on the solar surface.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1679;T dwarf stars;A type of brown dwarf with an effective temperature between about 1200 K and 500 K, i.e. colder than the preceding type L dwarf. The spectra of T dwarfs are characterized by the presence of methane bands in the near infrared. The presence of these bands, broad H_{2}O features, and H_2 collision-induced absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of T dwarfs compared to a black body at the same temperature. Hence near-infrared colors become increasingly blue (J - K ~ 0) as compared to L dwarfs. The first T dwarf, called Gl 229B, was discovered by Nakajima et al. The spectral classification scheme (subtypes T0 to T9) currently used was defined by Burgasser et al.

Synodic period 29d 12h 44m 2s.9. Orbital velocity 1.02 km s-1. The Moon's average visual albedo is 0.12, a factor of three smaller than that of Earth. The Moon's center of mass is displaced about 2 km in the direction of Earth. The average temperature on the surface of the Moon during the day is 107 °C. During the night, the average temperature drops to -153 °C. Studies of lunar rock have shown that melting and separation must have begun at least 4.5 x 109 years ago, so the crust of the Moon was beginning to form a very short time after the solar system itself.

Because of this synchronous rotation, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth, thus always presenting the same face, the nearside, toward Earth. The Moon may have formed during a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized rocky planet about 4.6 billion years ago; Theia.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/108;AGB;A region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram populated by evolving low-mass to intermediate-mass stars. These stars have an electron degenerate core of carbon and oxygen surrounded by two burning shells of helium and hydrogen. The H and He-burning shells are activated alternately in the deep layers of the star. An extended and tenuous convection envelope, having a radius of 10^4 - 10^5 times the size of the core, lies above these shells. The loosely bound envelope is gradually eroded by the strong stellar wind, which forms a dusty circumstellar envelope out to several hundreds of stellar radii. The convective envelope, stellar atmosphere, and circumstellar envelope have a rich and changing chemical composition provided by nucleosynthesis processes in the burning shells in the deep interior.

The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses. The luminosities of G-type giants are almost 30-60 times greater than that of the Sun, whereas the supergiants are 10,000-30,000 times more luminous.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/138;BAO;In cosmology, one of a series of peaks and troughs that are present in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations after the recombination era, and on large scales. At the time of the Big Bang, and for about 380,000 years afterwards, Universe was ionized and photons and baryons were tightly coupled. Acoustic oscillations arose from perturbations in the primordial plasma due to the competition between gravitational attraction and gas+photons pressure. After the epoch of recombination, these oscillations froze and imprinted their signatures in both the CMB and matter distribution. In the case of the photons, the acoustic mode history is manifested as the high-contrast Doppler peaks in the temperature anisotropies. As for baryons, they were in a similar state, and when mixed with the non-oscillating cold dark matter perturbations, they left a small residual imprint in the clustering of matter on very large scales, ~100 h^-1 Mpc (h being the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The phenomenon of BAOs, recently discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, is a confirmation of the current model of cosmology. Like Type Ia supernovae, BAOs provide a standard candle for determining cosmic distances. The measurement of BAOs is therefore a powerful new technique for probing how dark energy has affected the expansion of the Universe.
http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2105;Carbon enhanced metal poor stars;A star that presents very low iron abundances [Fe/H] < -4 but an anomalous richness in carbon. CEMP stars have been defined as a subset of metal-poor stars that exhibit elevated [C/Fe] ≥ +1.0. It has been recognized that ~15-20% of stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0 are carbon enhanced. This fraction rises to 30% for [Fe/H] < -3.0, to 40% for [Fe/H] < -3.5, and ~75% for [Fe/H] < -4.0. This increasing trend of CEMP-star frequency with declining [Fe/H] is confirmed by the observation of many thousands of CEMP stars.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2129;SED;A plot showing the energy emitted by a source as a function of the radiation wavelength or frequency. It is used in many branches of astronomy to characterize astronomical sources, in particular mainly in near infrared and middle infrared to study protostars or young stellar objects. The SED of these objects is divided in four classes. Class 0 in which the SED represents a very embedded protostar, where the mass of the central core is small in comparison to the mass of the accreting envelope. The SED is characterized by the blackbody radiation of the envelope and peaks at submillimeter wavelengths. Class I objects possess a SED that peaks in the far infrared and is characterized by a weak contribution of the blackbody of the central protostar (detected in near infrared) and the emission of a thick disk and dense envelope. These objects have less mass in the envelope and more massive central cores with respect to Class 0. Class II objects are the classical T Tauri stars with a SED due to the emission of a thin disk and the central star. They have accumulated most of their final mass and have dispersed almost completely their circumstellar envelope. Finally, Class III objects have pure photospheric spectra. Their SED is peaked in the optical and is well approximated by a blackbody emission with a faint infrared excess due to the presence of a residual optically thin disk that may be the origin of planetesimals. This classification scheme can be made more quantitative by defining a spectral index.

http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2127;SETI;The scientific attempt to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life by surveying the sky to find the existence of transmissions, especially radio waves or light, from a civilization on a distant planet. The SETI Institute, that carries out the project, is a private non-profit center founded in 1984. There are many methods that SETI scientific teams use to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these search billions of radio frequencies that reach Earth from all over the Universe, looking for an intelligent radio signal. Other SETI teams search by looking for signals in pulses of light emanating from the stars.

Pluto revolves around the Sun in a highly elliptical orbit at a mean distance of 39.5 astronomical units once every about 248 years. The orbit eccentricity is 0.25 (compare with the Earth's 0.02) yielding a perihelion distance of 29.66 astronomical units and an aphelion distance of 48.87 AU. Its orbital inclination is 17 degrees, which is much higher than those of the other planets. Pluto's mass is 1.308 x 10^22 kg, that is 0.00218 Earth mass (0.177 Moon mass), its equatorial radius is 0.19 Earth radius, and its rotation period is equal to 6.39 Earth days. It has five known satellites, in order of distance from Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto's radius is estimated to be about 1150 km (0.18 Earths). Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's satellites (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, and Triton). Pluto's surface has an estimated temperature of 37.5 K and is composed of more than 98% nitrogen  ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.
